NotITG changelog - version 4 (12/01/2020)
=========================================

### 🚨 BREAKING CHANGES

*   **YOU NEED A NEW SET OF .DLLs TO RUN NotITG v4**, - previous `Program/` folder no longer works as a result of the new .dlls
    *   We're distributing a full installation of the `Program/` directory this time, so what you'll need to do is download the entire folder and put it in your NotITG install.
        *   It'll have the .exe, .vdi and the new .dlls bundled inside. You can safely merge them into the old `Program/` folder.
    *   This also includes a Noteskins folder to merge with your current one, as some have been updated! You can just merge these with your current iterations, if applicable.
        *   Provided - `combination, cyber, default, divinentity, de-default, dunno, dunno2, proxynotes, randomhex, scalable, scalable2, sm3.9, Toshisan, vintage` You will very likely have file conflicts with existing noteskins - it's safe to just replace the conflicts, as they _need_ to be overwritten.
*   `squareoffset` and `bounceoffset` revised, now you don't have to multiply its value by 100
*   Player:GetNoteData() now returns the correct format for mines
    *   Formerly `100`, now `"M"`
        *   (This wasn't actually documented beforehand so no one knew about this)
*   Mods like `drunkoffset` and `tipsyoffset`, including axis and tan variants, have new behaviors
    *   Previous behavior can be found under the mod `drunkspacing`

### 💡 New Features!

#### Editing

*   `F3` + `9` in anywhere: Edit Last Edited Song
    *   We now properly select the last edited chart (if it was an edit difficulty) by saving the description to the stepmania.ini file instead of the difficulty.
*   `F3` + `0` in ScreenSelectMusic or ScreenGameplay: Edit Currently Playing Song
*   `Ctrl` + `[` in edit: Music preview starts from here (start marker)
*   `Ctrl` + `]` in edit: Music preview ends at here (end marker)
    *   It'll set the length of the preview automatically with this.
*   `Ctrl` + `O` in edit: Open song folder from edit mode
    *   This opens the song folder in a new Explorer window.
*   `Alt` + `Scroll` in editor now repositions the receptors on screen
*   Autoadvance mode selectable from editor preferences ( `ESC` -> `Preference` ) which moves the receptors down after placing down an arrow
    *   This is turned off by default.
*   ScreenEdit now shows current BPM along with Beat and Time
    *   Toggle by `Esc` -> `Preferences` -> `Show Beat, Time and Attack List during play`
*   `#NOSHUFFLE`: zone in .sm, allows user to determine segments of the chart that cannot be affected by shuffles such as Mirror and SmartBlender
    *   `#NOSHUFFLE:<StartBeat>=<EndBeat>,<StartBeat>=<EndBeat>,<StartBeat>=<EndBeat>`
*   Transform option "Swap note players" allows you to switch which players are to hit which notes within a region, while in couples editing mode.

#### Modding / Lua

*   Actor Lua errors will no longer crash as often!!! (Thanks, NAYOTO!)
    
    *   Feature of the decade,.,.,.,.,.
*   Fonts can be loaded relative to XML file now
    
*   `skewy` tween as a mod
    
*   New mod: `orient`
    
    *   Additionally rotates arrows in the direction of travel relative to "upwards".
    *   It can also be used in percentages, to increase or decrease or even invert the effect.
    *   For downwards scroll (e.g. with Reverse or splines), combine this mod with `314% ConfusionOffset`
*   `noteskewx` - Identical to `noteskew`
    
*   `noteskewy` - skewy for notes. noteskewx and y can also be column specific, e.g. `noteskewy2`
    
*   `waveoffset` - Affects the waveform of `wave`
    
*   Column specific wave and waveperiod -`wave2`, `waveperiod3`, etc.
    
*   Updated Lua from 5.0.2 to 5.0.3 (with some modifications)
    
    *   Enabled `debug` library.
    *   Some Lua 5.1 features have been added as well;
        *   Long strings and comments (Thanks, XeroOl!)
            *   You can use an arbitrary amount of `=` signs in the delimiters
            *   `[=[hello]=]`
            *   `--[==[Im a comment]==]`
        *   Added modulo operator `%`
            *   `5 % 3` is the same as `math.mod(5,3)`
        *   Added length operator `#`
            *   works on both strings and tables
            *   example: `#myTable` is the same as `table.getn(myTable)`
        *   Added hex number support: `0xA573`
    *   Fixed various other logic errors listed on the [Lua bugs list](https://www.lua.org/bugs.html).
*   Updated FFmpeg from 0.4.9-pre1 to 4.1.4
    
    *   Added .mp4, .webm, .mkv, .flv video file support
    *   Added .apng, .webp image/anim file support
    *   .gifs are now animated! ![Baby](https://notitg.heysora.net/img/baby.gif)
*   `Actor:skewy( skew: number )`
    
*   `Actor:addaux( deltaaux: number )`
    
*   `Actor:GetParent(): Actor`
    
*   `Actor:GetTweenTimeLeft(): number`
    
    *   The name explains itself - the number won't go negative.
*   `Actor:SetRotationOrder(): string` / `Actor:GetRotationOrder( order: string )`
    
    *   We're now able to change its order of euler rotation
    *   e.g. `SetRotationOrder( "xyz" )`
    *   `"zyx"` by default
*   `ActorFrame:GetChildren(): table`
    
*   `ActorFrame:GetSharedBGA(): ActorFrame`
    
*   `ActorFrame:GetOverlayScreens(): table`
    
*   `SCREENMAN` and `ActorFrame` have metamethods now
    
        local af = SCREENMAN() -- GetTopScreen()
        #SCREENMAN() -- GetTopScreen():GetNumChildren(), we get an ActorFrame first here
        SCREENMAN(5) -- GetTopScreen():GetChildAt(4) <- notice the index
        SCREENMAN("Overlay") -- GetTopScreen():GetChild("Overlay")
        
        af("PlayerP1") -- same as above, but on the ActorFrame directly
        af("PlayerP1")(2) -- chaining example, gets the second child on PlayerP1
        #af -- GetNumChildren()
        
    
*   Added input modes for screens
    
    *   Can be used to control which screens receives game input.
    *   `ScreenManager:SetInputMode( INPUT_ALL = 0 | INPUT_OVERLAY = 1 | INPUT_NONE = 2)`
*   `Song:GetNoteData( steps, [bool beatBased = true,] number startBeat = 0, number endBeat = -1 )`
    
    *   `Player:GetNoteData` already exists
*   `sprite:getstate()`
    
    *   Returns the current state of sprite
*   `sprite:looppoint( point: int )`
    
    *   This can be used to make multiple-state animations using a single spritesheet - such as having a run cycle set the loop point when starting/stopping a run.
*   `player:Reset<type>Splines( column: int )`
    
    *   Column specific reset splines
*   `player:SetArrowPathShader()` works now
    
*   Added Song methods:
    
    *   `GetDisplaySubTitle()`
    *   `GetTranslitSubTitle()`
    *   `GetBackgroundPath()`
    *   `GetMusicPath()`
    *   `GetSampleStartSeconds()`
    *   `GetSampleLengthSeconds()`
*   `GAMESTATE:GetCurrentNoteSkins()`
    
    *   returns a table of noteskin names that is currently in use
*   `GAMESTATE:GetRealPath( string )`
    
    *   It works pretty well with AdditionalSongFolders ``lua -- Assuming AdditionalSongFolders is `D:/AdditionalSongFolder` local songDir = GAMESTATE:GetCurrentSong():GetSongDir() GAMESTATE:GetRealPath(songDir .. "./fg/default.xml") -- Returns `D:/AdditionalSongFolder/Group/Song/fg/default.xml` ``
*   Added Shader Methods:
    
    *   Uniform Arrays
        *   `uniform1iv( string name, table )`
        *   `uniform1fv( string name, table )`
        *   `uniform2fv( string name, table )`
        *   `uniform3fv( string name, table )`
        *   `uniform4fv( string name, table )`
            *   e.g. `shader:uniform4fv( 'v4Array', { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 } )` sends a vec4 array where its length is 2
    *   Uniform Matrices
        *   `uniformMatrix2fv( string name, table )`
        *   `uniformMatrix3fv( string name, table )`
        *   `uniformMatrix4fv( string name, table )`
            *   e.g. `shader:uniformMatrix2fv( 'mat2Rotate', { 0.0, -1.0, 1.0, 0.0 } )` sends a 2x2 matrix
    *   Defines
        *   `define( string name, string/bool/number/nil )`
        *   `clearDefine( string name )`
            *   Basically you can inject `#define HOGE 4` on top of the shader code
    *   Compile Immediately
        *   `compileImmediate()`
            *   calling `define()` or `clearDefine()` does not automatically compile the shader. Call this function to compile it immediately (or to make it automatically compile when it uses the shader for the first time)
*   New MessageCommands:
    
    *   `WindowFocusMessageCommand`
    *   `WindowFocusLostMessageCommand`
*   `Profile:ClearHighScoresForSongAndSteps( song: string )`
    
*   `Profile:ClearHighScoresForSong( song: string )`
    
*   Simfiles can now temporarily override user's SmoothLines preference for one song with `GAMESTATE:ForceSmoothLines( 0 or 1 )`
    
    *   (used for the Groove Coaster lines in Line Delta and Got More Raves)
    *   Reset smoothlines back to user's setting with `GAMESTATE:ForceSmoothLines( -1 )`
*   basezoomz can finally be set `actor:basezoomz(float)` or `basezoomz,float`
    
*   actor:GetBaseZoomY() and `actor:GetBaseZoomZ()` added
    
*   New actor state getting methods, including the ability to get the current state of previously unknowable values, such as zoom and rotation
    
    *   `actor:GetRotationX()`
*   `actor:GetRotationY()`
    
*   `actor:GetRotationZ()`
    
*   `actor:GetCurrentRotationX()`
    
*   `actor:GetCurrentRotationY()`
    
*   `actor:GetCurrentRotationZ()`
    
*   `actor:GetCurrentZoomX()`
    
*   `actor:GetCurrentZoomY()`
    
*   `actor:GetCurrentZoomZ()`
    
*   `actor:GetSkewX()`
    
*   `actor:GetSkewY()`
    
*   Also available, current state of actors when taking into account active effects e.g. bob, wag and so on (Thanks, Melody!)
    
*   `actor:GetEffectX()`
    
*   `actor:GetEffectY()`
    
*   `actor:GetEffectZ()`
    
*   `actor:GetEffectRotationX()`
    
*   `actor:GetEffectRotationY()`
    
*   `actor:GetEffectRotationZ()`
    
*   An additional layer for actor position/rotation/scaling is now available
    
    *   `actor:x2(), y2, z2, zoomx2, zoomy2, zoomz2, rotationx2, rotationy2, rotationz2, skewx2, skewy2` (these cannot be tweened, and must be set via an update loop)
*   `Player:SetHiddenRegions( {{startBeat,endBeat,column},...} )` hides notes within the specified beat ranges. Omit the "column" parameter to hide all columns.
    
*   `Player:SetNoteTypeMults( {{startBeat,multiplier},...})` multiplies the note type (timing color) of every note beyond startBeat.
    
*   `Player:ClearHiddenRegions()` and `Player:ClearNoteTypeMults()` removes all sections of the specified type.
    

#### Themes

*   192nd quants for noteskins enabled, falls back to old behaviour if 192nd is missing

#### Misc.

*   #UNLOCK: A system is now in place for locking songs or certain charts behind conditions, that can be defined via lua.
    *   Conditions can be based on things like arbitrary globals, or high scores on certain songs using `PROFILEMAN`.
    *   Song unlock conditions are set via `#UNLOCK:someunlock.lua;` in the .sm file
    *   Chart unlock conditions are set via `#UNLOCKSTEPS:`
    *   Each chart can have a seperate unlock condition using `#UNLOCKSTEPS0:`, `#UNLOCKSTEPS2:` etc.,
    *   but note that `#UNLOCKSTEPS2:easy.lua; #UNLOCKSTEPS4:challenge.lua;` will be minified to `#UNLOCKSTEPS::easy.lua::challenge.lua::;`
    *   Example: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sn8nn2tll8k5cjj/unlocktest.lua?dl=0 Any lua can be used here. If the lua fails to compile, the song will be considered NOT locked and will show on the songwheel.
    *   Lua unlocks: Unlock command now accepts:
        *   `THIS_SONG` to refer to the song itself
        *   `THIS_GROUP` the group the song belongs to
        *   `THIS_PACK` Identical to `THIS_GROUP`
    *   `song:GetUnlockMethod( difficulty )` can be used to get the path directly to the lua file.
*   Added `NotITGKeymaps.ini`, which has the same format as SM5 Keymaps
*   `Data/NotITGPrefs.ini`:
    *   `OnlySongFolders`
        *   You can now choose to ONLY load specific song folders. Seperate with a comma.
    *   `FFmpegNumThreads`
        *   The amount of decode threads FFmpeg will use, defaults to `6`,
*   GameState:Get/SetExternal address is printed into the log at startup.

### 💪 Behavior Changes

#### Gameplay

*   A performance improvement on BitmapText (Thanks, Squirrel!)
*   Playing on Rate mods no longer un-syncs (Game now accounts for .009 ITG sync)
    *   See `NotITGPrefs.ini`, `RateMods9msOffsetFix`
*   Notefields are reset between marathon songs
*   Player 2 score saving is disabled when BothAtOnce is activated
*   Rate mods no longer sound terrible! (Thanks, Fraxtil!)
*   Fixed a bug where charts in the Edit difficulty slot sometimes fail to load correctly.
*   Autoplay being on at any point during an arrow being hit will now disqualify you, and this will be reflected on the results screen.
    *   This basically means that you won't get auto-disqualified if you have Autoplay on at the very start of the file - you'll have a window of opportunity to turn it off before the chart actually starts.
*   Finishing a course no longer lets you select another course after - your 'credit' will end
*   USB songs now preloads entire song directory
    *   Playing sound no longer crashes
    *   Custom courses now loads custom songs properly
*   Song background now always loads, even if BGBrightness preference is set to 0
*   `PlayerStageStats:GetCurrentLife()` now returns 0.001 (instead of 0) if no notes or mines have been hit yet.

#### Editing

*   BetterBackgrounds loads before Foreground in the editor now
*   FOV and vanishpoint resets when stopping in edit mode

#### Modding / Lua

*   SCREEN\_WIDTH and friends are more accurate, this affects widescreen play too
    *   It fixes a bug where some AFT trails slightly drift on widescreen only - e.g., in widescreen (16:9 ratio) on SL-based themes, SCREEN\_WIDTH is changed from 853 to 853.333… (or near enough)
    *   Simply Love is used as the example here because it defines width as 640 - this isn't necessarily the case for other themes!
*   Player:GetNoteData() now clamps to the last beat of the song
*   Proxied actors on ActorProxy can be disconnected
    *   Just pass nothing to it, example: `proxy:SetTarget()`
*   More XML attributes are scriptable
    *   Attribute `Type` set through Lua
    *   Attribute `Font`/`File` of `BitmapText` can be set through Lua
    *   Attribute `Frag` and `Vert` can be set through Lua
        *   They work similar to how you use `Condition`, but you have to start the line with `@`.
        *   Example: `<Layer Type="@spriteOrModel() or 'Sprite'" />`

#### Misc.

*   "Report crash" button now goes to the UKSRT Discord
*   `log.txt` and `info.txt` are now written to the `Data/` folder
*   `crashinfo-*.txt` is now written to the `Data/Crash/` folder
*   Key oem102 is treated as a seperate key and not as a second backslash
    *   ![](https://i.imgur.com/VF188d9.png)
*   MonkeyInput displays a system message every time it presses a key.
*   Serial now starts with `NITG-`

### 🐛 Bugfixes

#### Gameplay

*   Marathon mode no longer crashes if you fail with only one player enabled
*   Battle mode no longer crashes
*   Fixed ApproachType on music rates != 1.0x
*   Highscore of USB songs no longer disappears
*   Reset notefield between songs in marathon mode
*   Autosync now works properly with BothAtOnce
*   Miss Combo color now works properly.

#### Editing

*   Pressing `F3` + `0` while it's greyed out/not selectable no longer crashes the game
*   Couples editor crash when using 192nd notes has been fixed
*   No longer crashes if moving to next note while in couples mode
*   ScreenEdit shouldn't crash anymore with DelayedScreenLoad enabled (theme dependent)
*   Fixed hands count in Couples Mode

#### Modding / Lua

*   Fixed `DISPLAY:ShaderFuck()`
*   Fixed `GAMESTATE:GetFileStructure`
*   Fixed `Ctrl` + `R` crashes
    *   Crash had been seen in 10-1 and gat
*   Fixed crash caused by `Var=""` on xml actor loading
*   Drunkoffset now affects the left arrow :takimeme2:
*   Recreate() method fixes AFT texture clearing on nvidia
    *   NULCTRL (by Kaypooma) now works properly on nvidia
*   `ActorFrame:SetDrawFunction( function )` now works
*   Fixed edge case filename behavior
    *   `BitmapText`: `Foo [Bar]/Font [Page].png` now works properly, treated as `Font [Page]`.
    *   `Texture`: `Foo Bar 16x8/Texture sphere.png` now works properly, treated as `Texture sphere`

#### Misc.

*   Fixed random AV on quit
*   `CustomsLoadTimeout` now works properly

### 👾 Known Issues

*   We've found that `digital` and `digitalz` are _slightly_ offsync with each other
    *   We've prioritized its compatibility for now, and will review in a future update
*   `Ctrl` + `O` (Reveal Song Folder) currently does not work with AdditionalSongFolders

* * *
