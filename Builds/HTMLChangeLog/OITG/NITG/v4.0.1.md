NotITG changelog - version 4.0.1 (26/01/2020)
=============================================

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES

*   D3D has been removed
*   Anything that uses tanclip will behave differently
    *   Tanclip now actually clips tan waves used by modifiers. 100%+ = no tan wave.
    *   Files that used tanclip in the past have been updated by Ky\_Dash.

### üí° New Features!

*   `FailP1MessageCommand` and P2 has been added
    *   This will also trigger with FailOff enabled when health reaches 0
*   Added `GAMESTATE:GetCurBPM() : number`
    *   Returned value will be more accurate than `GAMESTATE:GetCurBPS()*60`
*   Added `Song:GetTimingData() : table BPMs, table stops`
    *   It returns two tables, each are sorted by beat.
    *   BPMs contains the beat and the new BPM
    *   stops contains the beat and the duration of the stop in seconds
*   `Profile:GetHighScoreForSongAndSteps`, `Profile:ClearHighScoresForSongAndSteps` and `Profile:ClearHighScoresForSong` also accept a Song instead of a String as its first argument

### üêõ Bugfixes

    *   Everything is so smooooooth, it's almost uncanny
    *   Try playing Got More Raves on a high refresh rate monitor
*   `bumpyz` added as an alias for `bumpy`
