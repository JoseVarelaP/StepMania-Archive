title: "Not In The Groove Version 4.9"
---

Changelog for v4.9:

### New Stuff
* New caching system, removing the need for FastLoad (in other words, no more FastLoad)
* BothAtOnce now supports navigation inside options menu
* Rebindable editor keys, you can change the binds of many editor actions by editing /Data/EditorKeymaps.ini
* Actor commands can now be chained (e.g `obj:rotationx(rx):rotationy(ry)`)
* `Player:SetArrowPathDrawMode(string DrawMode)`, default `"LineStrip"`: changes the draw mode of arrowpaths, valid values are `"LineStrip"`, `"Fan"`, `"Strip"` and `"Triangles"`
* `#SCROLLS` support within sm files, format is the same as ssc
* Transparent AFTs: `ActorFrameTexture:EnableAlphaBuffer(bool enable)` and `Actor:clearbuffer(int mode)` (1 = clear RGBA, 2 = clear only A)
* Support for loading 3D models from `.obj` files
* Ability to load NoteSkins from the song folder
    * Simply put your NoteSkin(s) in `/Songs/{group}/{song}/NoteSkins/{NoteSkinName}`, and enable those as you usually would (also read the next point!)
* Swap NoteSkins directly from lua without attacks:
`Player:SetNoteSkinForBeatRange(string NoteSkin, float StartBeat, float EndBeat)`
`Player:CacheNoteSkin(string NoteSkin)` (to avoid stutters during gameplay, call on file begin)
* Copy NoteData to clipboard from editor (Alt + C)
* Added actor methods `Actor:rotationxyz(float rotX, float rotY, float rotZ)` and
`Actor:addrotationxyz(float rotX, float rotY, float rotZ)`
* Ability to load .ini files from lua `FILEMAN:LoadIniFile(string path)`
* Ability to operate on mines in a shader via `uniform int isMine` 
* HoldJudgment actors are named for easier theming access: `HoldJudgmentCol<column>`
* The Music Selection songwheel now displays the best grade for each Player
* `THIS_DESCRIPTION` variable to access the step author / edit name of a chart within an unlock lua file
* `UNLOCKMAN:SongIsLocked(Song)` and `UNLOCKMAN:StepsIsLocked(Song, Steps)`
* Texture filename hint strings `noaniso`, `notrilinear`, `keepalpha` to disable anisotropic or trilinear filtering, or RGB values in fully transparent pixels
* `Model:SetUseFullAlphaRange(bool enable)` and `Player:SetUseFullAlphaRange(bool enable)`, default `false`: when enabled, models use a fixed version of RageDisplay::SetMaterial that properly applies alpha, making the 0-1 diffuse range line up with other actor types
* Player agnostic MessageCommands: sometimes you want to capture an action done by either player, but you don't need the information of *which* player it comes from. No more forgetting to duplicate your Commands for P2 in your menu simfiles
    * A list of introduced MessageCommands can be found [here](https://pipebomb.zip/notitg/messagecommands.txt)
* `NOTITG` and `NOTITG_VERSION` variants of the `FUCK_EXE` and `FUCK_VERSION` variables
* STATSMAN:GetCurStageStats():GetPlayerStageStats(int Player):`GetPossibleDancePointsCouplesP1()` and `STATSMAN:GetPossibleDancePointsCouplesP2()`: Get the possible amount of dance points for a specific player on 192nd separated couples charts
* `Steps:GetNoteData()`: Get the chart notedata from a Steps object. 
* `math.dog()`: math.dog
* Added wece
* Added whenge

### Fixes
* Fixed an important security vulnerability (removed a leftover legacy OpenITG function that allowed for TCP networking with possibility of making such interactions invisible to the user).
    * We have not seen this being exploited in the wild, and haven't received any reports of abuse.
  * Thanks to oatmealine for reporting this issue to us!
* `ScreenReadyCommand` fires at the beginning of every song in course mode (as opposed to only the first song)
* Extra Players who are receiving inputs from Players 1 or 2 properly reflect AutoPlay state when either AutoPlay or AutoPlayCPU gets enabled 
* Column specific `HoldStealth` properly applies
* Unlock lua variables `THIS_SONG` and `THIS_GROUP` are set as actual variables instead of engine side string replacement
    * (Also applies to the newly introduced `THIS_DESCRIPTION`)
* `Sound:DimMusic` can no longer deafen people
* `Player:SetRandomVanishTransform` has turn modes `"Mirror"` and `"SmartBlender"` added to its list of valid turn modes
* Prevent extremely specific modifier percentages from activating other song options
* Prevent LUA_PATH from being unset after doing Ctrl + R in gameplay
* Fixed some properties not resetting on Ctrl + R
* Prevent HiddenRegions and NoteTypeMults from being cleared after doing Ctrl + R during gameplay
* Fix AMD + Apple GPUs' model depth sorting
* GAMESTATE:SetSongEndTime() no longer interacts weirdly with ratemods
* Game will no longer crash with error "GAMESTATE->m_fMusicSeconds < 4000" on charts with no notes
* Trying to call GetPlayerStageStats on an invalid Player will raise an error
* AutoSync no longer has the potential of receiving inputs from non-existant players
* Stealth now displays properly on Wine
    * ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
