OpenITG, alpha 4 (March 21st, 2008)
-----------------------------------

Essentially, this is a bug-fix release for alpha 3. Sorry if this is a
bit of a let-down, but I promise that you'll appreciate the work that's
been done. :) I imagine we'll be doing this release-and-bugfix thing in
the future as well.

-Fixed Win32 bugs:
    OpenITG hangs/crashes/<bad stuff> when custom songs sample plays
    Backgrounds are centered on the top left during gameplay
    (Maybe?) Color1 as boolean LUA parsing error
-Fixed cross-platform bugs:
    Editor's stepchart doesn't scroll properly
-Fixed package mistakes:
    data.zip causes "Assertion 'm_LockCnt == 0' failed" error
