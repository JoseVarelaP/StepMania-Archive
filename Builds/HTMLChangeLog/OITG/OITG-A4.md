title: "OpenITG, alpha 4"
---

```
-Fixed Win32 bugs:
    OpenITG hangs/crashes/<bad stuff> when custom songs sample plays
    Backgrounds are centered on the top left during gameplay
    (Maybe?) Color1 as boolean LUA parsing error
-Fixed cross-platform bugs:
    Editor's stepchart doesn't scroll properly
-Fixed package mistakes:
    data.zip causes "Assertion 'm_LockCnt == 0' failed" error
