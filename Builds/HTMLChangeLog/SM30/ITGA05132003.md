This is the earliest build known to be existant in the wild of In The Groove.

Some elements from this build noting as a comparison from the [Roxor website back from the day (Dating December 2003)](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202030216/http://www.roxorgames.com/itg.html):

* Duo battle is present but not actually fully working. Attacks can be achieved and sent to a mysterious third opponent that is running on the background as the attacks are not sent to the accompanying player.

* Most songs shown on the [first screenshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202030216im_/http://www.roxorgames.com/images/groove_screenshot_3.jpg) are not present, they would start to appear on the July alpha and onwards.

* Seems to be the first build to have the 3D wheel implemented...?
* VerTex is credited to Kyle Ward in this version, not ZigZag.
	* [The audio is slightly different as well](/SMArchive/Builds/HTMLChangeLog/SM30/ITGAlphaMay2005/VerTex.mp3) specially at the second break.
		
	* The charts for this song also end abruptly before the song can end.
	
* Tempest mode [(As seen in one of the screenshots)](/SMArchive/Builds/HTMLChangeLog/SM30/ITGAlphaMay2005/screen0010.bmp), an unique perspective mod is present, and it's only current known build to have it.
* This build features a GrooveBar, which is the triangle representation of the stats seen on the Music Wheel. It had some iterations before being taken out (even being present on OpenITG) during the SM4 transition.
* It comes with three noteskins, which have lighting embeded into them to reflect from the metal border, depending on their current position and player's current perspective.
* Up until the beta, the game only carries three difficulties: <span style="color: lightgreen;">Chill</span>, <span style="color: yellow;">Jam</span> and <span style="color: red;">Killer</span>,
	which contrasts with the available difficulties that SM3.0 already had.

* It contains several versions of the theme, with varying grades of progress and stability.
* The difficulty selection screen (on <i>groove.not-cvs</i>) theme has no limit of what difficulty to pick, so you can go out of bounds on the selection.
* the <i>itg_mode</i> theme [contains unmodified graphics of the illustrations on the style selection icons](/SMArchive/Builds/HTMLChangeLog/SM30/ITGAlphaMay2005/single-arcade-medium-diff.png)
* Similar to StepMania 3.0, pressing start at any point on any ScreenOptions generated screen will instantly end the screen and save settings.
* This version of the theme has support up to 7 stages (including final).

<!--<p>Data from this build seems to suggest it might be close to the version showcased on the screenshots on the Roxor website back in Fe</p>-->
