<p>This is the earliest build known to be existant in the wild of In The Groove.</p><br>
<p>Some elements from this build noting as a comparison from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031202030216/http://www.roxorgames.com/itg.html">Roxor website back from the day (Dating December 2003)</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Duo battle is present but not actually fully working. Attacks can be achieved and sent to a mysterious third opponent that is running on the background as the attacks are not sent to the accompanying player.</li>
	<li>Most songs shown on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031202030216im_/http://www.roxorgames.com/images/groove_screenshot_3.jpg">first screenshot</a> are not present, they would start to appear on the July alpha and onwards.</li>
	<li>Seems to be the first build to have the 3D wheel implemented...?</li>
	<li>VerTex is credited to Kyle Ward in this version, not ZigZag.
		<ul>
			<li><a href="/SMArchive/Builds/HTMLChangeLog/SM30/ITGAlphaMay2005/VerTex.mp3">The audio is slightly different as well</a>, specially at the second break.</li>
			<li>The charts for this song also end abruptly before the song can end.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Tempest mode <a href="/SMArchive/Builds/HTMLChangeLog/SM30/ITGAlphaMay2005/screen0010.bmp">(As seen in one of the screenshots)</a>, an unique perspective mod is present, and it's only current known build to have it.</li>
	<li>This build features a GrooveBar, which is the triangle representation of the stats seen on the Music Wheel. It had some iterations before being taken out (even being present on OpenITG) during the SM4 transition.</li>
	<li>It comes with three noteskins, which have lighting embeded into them to reflect from the metal border, depending on their current position and player's current perspective.</li>
	<li>Up until the beta, the game only carries three difficulties: <span style="color: lightgreen;">Chill</span>, <span style="color: yellow;">Jam</span> and <span style="color: red;">Killer</span>,
		which contrasts with the available difficulties that SM3.0 already had.</li>
	<li>It contains several versions of the theme, with varying grades of progress and stability.</li>
	<li>The difficulty selection screen (on <i>groove.not-cvs</i>) theme has no limit of what difficulty to pick, so you can go out of bounds on the selection.</li>
	<li>the <i>itg_mode</i> theme <a href="/SMArchive/Builds/HTMLChangeLog/SM30/ITGAlphaMay2005/single-arcade-medium-diff.png">contains unmodified graphics of the illustrations on the style selection icons</a>.</li>
	<li>Similar to StepMania 3.0, pressing start at any point on any ScreenOptions generated screen will instantly end the screen and save settings.</li>
	<li>This version of the theme has support up to 7 stages (including final).</li>
</ul>

<!--<p>Data from this build seems to suggest it might be close to the version showcased on the screenshots on the Roxor website back in Fe</p>-->
