##### StepP1 1.0.2 Release

Patch notes:

- Default video renderer has changed to DirectX, fixes freezes on some computers when attempting to change video settings
- Fixed Random channel not showing up
    - Due to RageFile limitations, the Screenshots folder was removed in order for the game to read RandomSongs once again
- Added letter grades to be displayed with personal scores, machine scores and on the step chart list
    - Due to high score limitations in not being able to save stage break conditions, all grades will be colored
    - Some charts might display scores from other charts, this is due to them sharing the same difficulty and details and roots back to being a StepMania issue. Sorry for any inconveniences
- Fixed alignment issues with certain UI elements when running the game in 4:3
- New step chart artist label added while loading into gameplay (SofiaXY)
- New StepP1 logo which better resembles the original Event graphic (SofiaXY)
