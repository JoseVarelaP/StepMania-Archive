sm-ssc v1.0 Public Beta 4 | 20100531
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The letter grade tiers have been reset to the old SM4CVS/3.9 values. You
should probably reset your scores to maintain consistency. (Though if you
used themes with their own scoring system, you never had consistency in the
first place. :s)

20100531
--------
* [Trail] Add GetTrailEntry() Lua binding.
* [TrailEntry] Allow TrailEntry to push itself, making Lua bindings possible.
  TrailEntry's Lua bindings include GetSong(), GetSteps(), IsSecret() and
  GetNormalModifiers().

20100527
--------
* Add Direction param to ChangeStepsMessage.

20100526
--------
* Enable upper diagonal keys for Positive Gaming Impact dance mat [corec]

20100525
--------
* [ScreenSelectProfile] Actually load player's last used settings.
* [ScreenNetEvaluation] Don't assume every theme has a Grade display and/or
  Points display; This fixes crashes in themes which don't have them when
  people go to view another player's stats.
* [ScoreKeeperNormal] add [Gameplay] MaxScoreToIncrementMissCombo metric.
* [Course] add GetCourseDir(), HasBackground(), IsAnEdit() Lua bindings.
* [GameManager] rework how the IsGameEnabled() Lua binding works:
  it now takes a string as a parameter.
* [ScoreKeeper] allow ScoreKeeperRave to be used as a ScoreKeeper.
* [ThemeManager] add GetCurLanguage() Lua binding.

20100522
--------
* [CourseLoaderCRS] up the maximum size of an edit course from 30KB to 32KB;
  allow the #BACKGROUND tag to be read from .crs files.
* [HelpDisplay] new TipSwitchTime metric
* [PrefsManager] add PreferenceExists(sPrefName) Lua binding;
  removed now-unused ShowSelectGroup preference.
* [ScreenSelectMusic] make the ScoreDisplay 0 out if nothing is selected.

20100518
--------
* The great Lua binding addition begins...
 * [Actor] GetHAlign(), GetVAlign()
 * [LifeMeterBattery] GetLivesLeft()
 * [MemoryCardManager] GetCardLocked(pn), IsNameAvailable(pn)
 * [MenuTimer] GetSeconds()
 * [PlayerStageStats] GetRadarPossible(), GetRadarActual()
 * [ProfileManager] LastLoadWasFromLastGood(pn), LastLoadWasTamperedOrCorrupt(pn)

20100515
--------
* [AnnouncerManager] Lua bindings get added to AnnouncerManager, which now
  exists as ANNOUNCER. New bindings:
  ANNOUNCER:DoesAnnouncerExist(sAnnouncer)	- returns a bool
  ANNOUNCER:GetAnnouncerNames()				- returns a table of strings
  ANNOUNCER:GetCurrentAnnouncer()			- returns a string
  ANNOUNCER:SetCurrentAnnouncer(sAnnouncer)	- Sets the announcer if it exists.

20100513
--------
* [ScreenEvalation] Graphic "time label" renamed to "TimeLabel" for the sake
  of naming consistency.
* Add GetOSName() binding. Returns a string representing the current OS.
* Allow Negative stops to "work" again in Quirks Mode.
* [ScreenSelectMaster] Fix "THE" cursor crash by testing if the cursor object
  is actually there (a.k.a. not null). It should be noted that cursors can
  still crash, however. (yay bugs)

20100512
--------
* [NotesLoaderSM] Only apply the old .sm format difficulty hacks if
  difficulty == Difficulty_Hard.
* [TimingData] add HasNegativeBpms() Lua binding.

20100507
--------
* [PaneDisplay] Show fallback values when Song/Course is null.

20100506
--------
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Make it so changing difficulty also cancels
  TwoPartSelection if TwoPartConfirmsOnly.

20100504
--------
* [ScreenGameplay] Un-hardcoded the diffuse command on CourseSongNumber.

20100502
--------
* Add dance-threepanel StepsType. Thanks to kurisu for the original 3.9 code.
* XMode mod added, thanks to v1toko/StepNXA.
* [Song] add GetDisplayBpms() [a table of two floats], IsDisplayBpmSecret(),
  IsDisplayBpmConstant() [both bools] Lua bindings

20100501
--------
* Fixed an issue with StepsDisplayList crashing if more than 21 difficulties are
  playable. This allows Technomotion to work with AutoSetStyle and Autogen on.
