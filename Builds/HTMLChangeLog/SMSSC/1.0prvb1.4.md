title: "sm-ssc Private Beta Wave 1.4 | 20100125"
---

20100125
--------
* Catching up with StepMania 4 SVN. All code by Glenn Maynard.
 * r28254 (GameConstantsAndTypes.h GameManager.cpp): routine style for pump
 * r28255 Steps.cpp: fix routine special case so it works in all styles
 * r28256 ScoreKeeper.cpp: support ScoreKeeperShared in
   ScoreKeeper::MakeScoreKeeper
 * r28257 ScreenGameplayShared.cpp: update old ScreenGameplayShared code
   to mostly use PlayerInfo::Load; fixes some stuff but still not right

20100124
--------
* [Player] new ScoreMissedHoldsAndRolls metric (FSX)
* [Song] add GetFirstBeat and GetLastBeat Lua bindings
* Make RandomBackgroundMode use BGMODE_RANDOMMOVIES by default

20100122
--------
* Add support for Pump It Up delays with #DELAYS tag in .sm files & treating all
  stops in .KSF files as delays.
* Use RollingNumbers methods in ScreenNetEvaluation now that ScreenEvaluation
  uses them, as opposed to settext (which caused a few visual issues).
* [ScreenEvaluation] add SongOptions as a metric-able item.

20100119
--------
* Make FGAnimations (#FGCHANGES:) work again. (hopefully; it semeed to work
  using a test file.)

20100118
--------
mostly [ScreenNetSelectBase] related changes:
* remove some now-unused metrics (namely ChatInputBoxWidth/Height and
  ChatOutputBoxWidth/Height).
* Rename "Meter" to "StepsDisplay"
* RoomWheel now uses a MusicWheel-like setup for items (NormalPart/ColorPart)
  instead of a single bar graphic.

20100117
--------
* [ScreenNetSelectBase] Sprite -> AutoActor for chat boxes, un-hardcode some
  commands on items to allow for better theming.
* Disable Control+Letter "sort by title" shortcut in course mode.

20100116
--------
* Pump-Doubles has better (more accurate?) spacing between the two sides
* Enable saving replays. The replay data format will likely change over time,
  and there is currently no mechanism to replay the data back as another player.

20100114
--------
* add GAMESTATE:GetHardestStepsDifficulty() Lua binding
* Don't complain about #SELECTABLE:Roulette; even though it's not implemented
  for some reason.

20100112
--------
* Added more milestones (25, 50, 250)
* {issue 73} If the wheel is locked, don't accept Ctrl+Letter to sort
* [NotesLoaderKSF] implement DirectMove |E| type (DelayBeat)

20100111
--------
* [CourseLoaderCRS.cpp] add GRADEBEST and GRADEWORST to possible values.

20100107
--------
* [GameConstantsAndTypes.h] bump MAX_METER from 13 to 20.
* [MemoryCardManager] add GetName(pn) Lua binding. Returns the name of the device.
