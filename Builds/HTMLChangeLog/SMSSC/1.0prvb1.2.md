Theme-related additions/bugfixes aren't listed here, usually.

20091218
--------
* Fix bug in GAMESTATE:GetCurrentSteps(pn) where it didn't bother trying to
  return the player's actual steps before trying to do:
  (1) SongUtil::GetOneSteps( p->m_pCurSong.Get(), GAMESTATE->GetCurrentStyle()->m_StepsType, GAMESTATE->m_PreferredDifficulty[pn] );
  (2) SongUtil::GetOneSteps( p->m_pCurSong.Get(), GAMESTATE->GetCurrentStyle()->m_StepsType, GAMESTATE->GetClosestShownDifficulty(pn) );
  And with AutoSetStyle on, how the hell is it going to know the style with
  those two SongUtil things in the way? By moving the player's steps to the
  top, that fixes the problem. -aj
