20091205
--------
* [Player.cpp/.h] new metric: ComboUnderField. It should be true by default if
  you want to match how StepMania 4 does it. [AJ]

20091204
--------
* Fix a sm-ssc bug where you couldn't change course difficulties.

20091203
--------
* Two new GameCommands:
 * fademusic,fVolume,fDuration (though I wish fDuration was how long to fade the
   music for; instead the fade lengths are consts in GameSoundManager.)
 * pushscreen,sScreenName (though it doesn't push screens like I had thought it
   would. maybe I'm doing it wrong.) [AJ]

20091202
--------
* Profile name max length changed from 12 to 32 characters. [AJ]
* Modified character camera values. [shakesoda]

20091201
--------
* [ScreenSelectMusic] new metric SamplePreviewMusicMode, which has one of two
  possible values as of r127. 'SamplePreviewMusicMode_Normal' is business as
  usual (sample music plays), while 'SampleMusicPreviewMode_ScreenMusic'
  disables song samples, using /{theme}/Sounds/ScreenSelectMusic loop music.*
  as the file to play. No, this doesn't support Lua music yet. [AJ]
