The very first version of the game ever made, developed by Chris Danford from May to August of 2001.

A list of features, [as written by Chris on his website](https://web.archive.org/web/20010816064900/http://www.chrisdanford.com:80/projects/ddrpced/index.htm):

- 4 pad support!  Now 4 people can play single at the same time, and 2 people can play Double on the same set of notes!
- MP3 support - no more uncompressed WAVs!
- Use any AVI or MPG video as the dancing background - even music videos!
- Full DirectInput support for PC gamepads, and PSX gamepad support with a PSX-USB converter.
- Simpler song directory structure.  Everything needed to play a song goes in one directory.
- Record your own .steps files by actually dancing to the song!  No more editing pages of steps in notepad.

As for progress on this build, he mentions the following:

- All graphics, sound, input, and sprite libraries are complete.
- Input mapping configuration is complete
- Menu system is complete
- Song Selection, Step Selection, and Results states are 80% complete.
- The gameplay is 100% playable, but a few of the details (dancing score, health meter) are still unimplemented.  
- The 2x-double-pad and 4x-single-pad game modes are complete.
