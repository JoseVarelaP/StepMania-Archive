## Alpha 4.8.3 September 08th 2020 "Throw us a bone (index)" 
This build did not pass Quality Assurance, and was not released outside of the internal Alpha Testing teams. Apologies for the Delay on this release. The changelog for 4.8.3 and 4.8.5 are together in this monthly update.

There has also been a need to temporarily remove the 'StepMania' name from the project due to a complaint received and we have been requested to rebrand the project to Project OutFox until we sort out the paperwork.
