IF YOU HAVE A BLACK SCREEN ON LOADING DUE TO NOUVEAU/ATI DRIVERS, GO INTO YOUR PREFERENCE.INI AND SET HIGHRES_TEXTURES TO AUTO!!!!</strong></h1>
<p><code>HighResolutionTextures=ForceOn</code> needs to be <code>HighResolutionTextures=Auto</code>
However, some machines may need it to be <code>HighResolutionTextures=ForceOff</code>
You may also need to set your <code>MaxTextureResolution=2048</code> to <code>MaxTextureResolution=1024</code> as well.</p>
<h2 id="gg-hotfix-patch">GG HotFix patch</h2>
<p>Thanks to several upstream issues, we&#39;ve taken the decision to move the underlying version of the SDL engine back to how it was on 4.9.6, and we&#39;ll monitor and troubleshoot the issues some of you guys faced in 4.9.7. We apologise for those on Linux for the issues, and we have now forked our own SDL branch to doublecheck for issues in the future.</p>
