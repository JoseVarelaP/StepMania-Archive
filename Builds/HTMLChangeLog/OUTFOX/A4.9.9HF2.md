### (Incorporates Internal Builds 4.9.9HF-rc0 to 4.9.9HF-rc4)

This build fixes several of the reported bugs, as we had to pull the previous release due to operating system updates between release dates. Sometimes having a monthly release schedule is awesome, but it does tire us out!

Anyways... Lets get back to the update.

This mini hotfix (v2) includes a few things we were going to leave to the next release, but as we had to fix bugs in them anyway, it was easier to apply.

### **ALL:**

* ❕✅ Fixed SM hash corruption
* ❕✅ Fixed DWI being loaded due to lazy people not cleaning their simfile folders
* ❕✅ The system will not load DWI if an ssc or sm is found
* ❕✅ Fixed odd SM title bug
* ❕✅ Fixed Crash with older hardware not supporting what it advertises
* ❕✅ Fixed Crash with course loading that affected some folks with >640 songs
* ❕✅ Fixed Notesloader issues with Mac and Linux
* ❕✅ Fixed GCC / Mac compile
* ❕✅ Fixed Windows 10/11 affinity issues
* ❕✅ Fixed Occasional spike on Windows 10/11 when using an XInput controller
* ❕✅ Taiko adjustments for notefield
* ❕✅ Fixed SM/SSC loading to be more cabinet friendly.
