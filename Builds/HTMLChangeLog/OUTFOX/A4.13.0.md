## Announcing ``stepstage`` mode!

![stepstagegameplayold](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/153197662-982c4b7e-26b7-43b8-a036-4db81f9f4fdb.jpg)

This month we are proud to announce initial support for the ``stepstage`` mode. This mode is a simulation of the game _Stepping Stage_ released in the arcade by the company _Jaleco_ in 2000.

![steppingstage cab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/153202754-5205b725-2400-4003-b6d4-08f518d6fa76.png)

This game featured quite a unique layout, having 3 panels of input per column. The game used a dual column layout for the 'normal' mode, which had 6 inputs total, with the left hand side of the pad being for left, and right side being right. There is a much easier 'single' mode where all 6 pads are placed on a single column, but only the _colour_ is needed to be hit, with the 'left or right' side being ignored.

There was a home release of this game called _Stepping Selection_ released for the _PlayStation 2_, and naturally, _Project OutFox_ supports the use of this pad via the usual adapter, so you can play at home on the original dance mat.

The mode supports autoGen and can use dance/pump/kb6 charts to great success, and does support modfile cross-generation, so you can see the cool effects in this mode.

### What about other dance pads?

If you have a dance pad with has the input buttons there are noteskins to help remind you of this so you can play this mode with the far right column, and far left:

This can allow you to play on any 9/8 panel mat made for other games with this mode, using Top Left / Left / Bottom Left and Top Right / Right / Bottom Right for the inputs.

# Announcing OutFox Serenity Volume 1 Winter Update! 

Welcome to OutFox Serenity, the official community song pack project for Project OutFox! Its purpose is to produce packs of "libre" songs for the game that can be freely redistributed (including as part of its default, bundled songs), and to showcase the extended mode support of Project OutFox by offering charts for multiple game types beyond just 4-key styles.

Initially released on August 27, 2021, OutFox Serenity Volume I featured music by Aspid Cat, Drazil, Jack5, Matduke, mmry, PizeroFox, Seo, and Sevish. Alongside 4-panel ``dance`` and 5-panel ``pump`` charts, most of its songs also have ``be-mu``, ``po-mu``, ``techno`` (8- and 9-panel), ``gddm``, ``gdgf``, and ``gh`` charts. 

The Winter Update to OutFox Serenity Volume I features three new songs by DJ Megas, Matduke and Pekoneko (ペコネコ). It also includes changes to some of the existing songs from Volume 1, including additional charts, and key-sounded ``be-mu``/``po-mu`` and ``gh`` charts for selected songs.

### To download the game _including_ the Serenity Pack, look for the download for your system which has ``Serenity`` in the Filename.

# **KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.13.0**

* ❕❌ **ISSUE** Playing ``be-mu``/``po-mu`` songs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading. Please be aware that course mode for these modes are a bit temperamental at the moment!
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``gh`` mode: Some charts may cause a crash when loaded into the game
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``gddm``/``gdgf`` mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it'll play silent.
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** Charts with similar difficulties in a folder will have scores assigned to them weirdly, due to the old SM paradigm. This will be fixed in a future update.
