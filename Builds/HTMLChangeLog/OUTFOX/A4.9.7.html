<h1 id="nvidia-460-driver-issues-windows-hotfix-">Nvidia 460+ Driver Issues + Windows HotFix!</h1>
<p>There has been a flurry of bug reports due to the new GeForce Experience based drivers moving into 460. There are some quite fundamental changes in this driver that have affected our LowLevelWindow system, and the way we draw. The latter will be fixed over the coming months, so we can be proactive and fix the issue before it becomes a game breaking situation. There is no way to &#39;force&#39; a <code>bit per pixel</code> or <code>bpp</code> in this version, as it&#39;s being moved into a different function, that we will re-expose in the next alpha. This has no affect on gameplay or mode changes in the game, however it means if you&#39;re on a system we consider <code>historic</code> (&lt;1999) or <code>vintage</code> (2000 - 2007), you may need to force the settings in the preference.ini to set your &#39;texture color depth&#39; to 16. as always if you have any questions or need help, do not hesitate to reach out to us in our discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/hSHPAU37t8">https://discord.gg/hSHPAU37t8</a></p>
<p>We are still working on restoring some settings changed in the operating system in the 20H2, which can limit frame rate, force your GPU to change delta clock accuracy and even affect the kernel poll/tick rate. These issues will be resolved in a future update as we find out more from Windows Dev support/MSDN.</p>

<h1 id="stepmania-random-number-generation">StepMania Random Number Generation</h1>
<p>Since the beginning of this project, we have had a few bug reports about the &#39;random&#39; number generator in the game not being... well, random at all. We have been spending some of the time in the downtime over the holiday to actually look into this and we discovered that the system was indeed not performing remotely as designed, and has been broken since late 2004. The main bug report was #22 and #59 by @PCBoyGames and well, we discovered that on further investigation, those bugs were caused to a misinterpretation of the <em>way</em> that the random generator was designed and how it should be used in getting/acquiring a random number.</p>
<h2 id="supershuffle-blender-and-soft_shuffle">SuperShuffle/Blender and Soft_Shuffle</h2>
<p>This was further crushed in it&#39;s delivery with shuffle and super shuffle, and anything really that relied on these broken systems. To resolve them we have removed the 1999 era code and modernised it to current modern standards. This has the benefit of completely fixing SuperShuffle (Blender on old versions) and now the distribution is as expected, not to the left.</p>

<p>This has the side effect of making the randomness different <em>for each player</em> so bear this in mind if you&#39;re going to play! We will add a Mirror function for this so Player 1 = Player 2 in the future.</p>
<h2 id="portal-on-the-music-wheel">PORTAL on the Music Wheel</h2>
<p>Those of you that use the default theme, we have returned a feature that was oddly missing on 5.3, and that was the Portal slot next to Roulette and Random.</p>
<p><strong>What is Portal?</strong>
Portal will pick at random from an open folder/group and if you move on it and away from it it will select a different song. 
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/108597571-94d69b80-7381-11eb-96e2-44ffda63a574.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>If you close your folder so none are open, then portal will pick at random from your whole collection for that mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/108597591-bc2d6880-7381-11eb-93d1-e03661d119d6.png" alt="image"></p>
<h2 id="extended-mode">Extended Mode</h2>
<p>Most Played should now spawn songs, I sadly have a low level of played songs due to this being a development build, but you can get the general gist of how this system works.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/108598477-bcc7fe00-7385-11eb-8dc6-cd13d2df9f3d.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Folder Courses now spawn a collection as expected, and should be different

<h2 id="oni-mode">ONI Mode</h2>
<p>With the new random modes now working as expected, this has been a welcome quality of life for ONI mode: Artist songs are now shuffled as expected!</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/108598308-d7e63e00-7384-11eb-8422-a753eef64524.png" alt="image"></p>
<h2 id="endless-mode">Endless Mode</h2>
<p>This mode has never been given any love so far from the dev team, so much so even the layout hasn&#39;t been finalised! We will look at fixing this and making this mode consistent in the future, so forgive the &#39;default&#39; looking layout.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/108598699-082edc00-7387-11eb-9a14-f93d562e6698.png" alt="image"></p>
<h2 id="random-attacks">Random Attacks</h2>
<p>There were issues with how this methodology was supposed to actually work, as it likely has been broken for so long. Well in this release, we have unique <em>per player</em> random attacks for that extra challenge! The text file RandomAttacks.txt in your /Data file can be filled with fiendish ideas that can help or hinder a player, so do take a moment to be naughty (or nice!) and populate that file with some cool effects!</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/108599677-732de200-738a-11eb-94ca-2d471e4a2ca4.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>With the removal of the legacy code and the new updates, we can happily say that we have squashed 37 upstream bugs that have been around since the SM 3.0 era.</p>
