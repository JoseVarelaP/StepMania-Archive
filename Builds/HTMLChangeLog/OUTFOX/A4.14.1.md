## New Versioning, folders, and a short news update.

Following this release _OutFox_ will be officially dropping the ``5.3`` prefix from our versioning to lessen confusion from our user base. We used to be 5.3.0.4.xx.xx as we were working on the game, but many of our users preferred to use the Alpha 4.xx versioning, leaving the 5.3 alone. Following consultation with ensuring we are compliant with our binary signing requirements, we have decided to drop this long version number and just use the 0.x.y.z which is a lot easier to read.

Internally we were using the alpha builds like this to simplify our own understanding, and it seemed the easiest way to move forward. This build is formally known as ``0.4.14``, and we will be dropping versioning from folders and suchlike moving onward. We have removed the final parts that we needed for validation, so we are pleased to announce signed binaries for Windows will be available in the summer.

Given this change, the location of the save folders has changed. Following here are the new save locations:
(If you're in an existing installation, you can just rename your existing save folder to the new name that belongs to your OS)

Windows: `%AppData%\Roaming\Project OutFox` (If in non-portable mode)
MacOS: `~/Library/Preferences/Project OutFox`
Linux: `~/.project-outfox/`

Themes or systems which check for 'StepMania' in the product family may fail to find OutFox until updated, we have reached out to the developers of Simply Love and let them know about our updates and they have let us know it will be updated in due course.

# If you are using using Simply Love please follow the guide below to replace the files in the mean time.

# Simply Love fixes needed for Alpha 4.14

With the change of the Product Family and ID to OutFox and dropping the 5.3 suffix, there will be instances where Simply Love will break again due to its checks for "stepmania", so changes will need to be made.

(The files mentioned on this guide are included on the binaries section)

> Upon starting the game, I get a message saying this build is unsupported.

That's the inital check coming from `SL-SupportHelpers.lua`, in a function called `StepManiaVersionIsSupported()`, which checks which versions of the game are supported. Only a single new line needs to be added to support OutFox on the list.

(Located in `Simply Love/Scripts/SL-SupportHelpers.lua`)
```lua
StepManiaVersionIsSupported = function()
	-- Add this line!
	if type(ProductID) == "function" and ProductID():find("OutFox") then return true end

	if type(ProductFamily) ~= "function" or ProductFamily():lower() ~= "stepmania" then return false end
	if type(ProductVersion) ~= "function" then return false end
	if type(ProductVersion()) ~= "string" then return false end

	-- SM5.0.12 is supported (latest stable release)
	-- SM5.1.x is supported
	-- SM5.2 is not supported because it saw significant
	--       backwards-incompatible API changes and is now abandoned
	-- SM5.3.x is supported (beta status because it's not open source yet)
	return IsSMVersion(5, 0, 12) or IsSMVersion(5, 1) or IsSMVersion(5, 3)
end
```

> When I finish a song, the theme keeps failing me, what is that?

That comes from a check from a file called `FailOnHoldStart.lua`. Given the changes to how OutFox now calculates the end of the song, this can break the theme's method to calculate its own end point.

(Located in `Simply Love/BGAnimations/ScreenGameplay overlay/FailOnHoldStart.lua`)
```lua
-- We need a way to check if the player gave up before the song properly ended.
-- It doesn't look like the engine broadcasts any messages that would be helpful here,
-- so we do the best we can by checking the song position.

local af = Def.ActorFrame{
	OffCommand=function(self)
		-- Replace this line!
		local fail = STATSMAN:GetCurStageStats():GaveUp()
		-- local fail = (GAMESTATE:GetCurMusicSeconds() < GAMESTATE:GetCurrentSong():GetLastSecond())

		-- In course mode always fail if we're not already on the last
		-- song. If we are on the last song, then we fall back to the
		-- condition above.
		if GAMESTATE:IsCourseMode() then
			local course = GAMESTATE:GetCurrentCourse()
			if GAMESTATE:GetCourseSongIndex() + 1 < course:GetNumCourseEntries() then
				fail = true
			end
		end

		-- We have to fail both players as we stopped the song early.
		if fail then
			-- Let's fail the bots as well.
			for player in ivalues( GAMESTATE:GetEnabledPlayers() ) do
				local pss = STATSMAN:GetCurStageStats():GetPlayerStageStats(player)
				pss:FailPlayer()
			end
		end
	end,
}

return af
```

## Announcing a cross platform ParaPara Paradise Driver!

![image](https://kirakira.org/XD/wp-content/uploads/Controller-Guide.png)
##### Thanks to eks-d parapara for the image! (https://paramania.kirakira.org/ has an OutFox supported theme!)

---

Following an overwhelming demand from the community, we have rewritten the old legacy PPP controller driver from the PS2 to work on all devices _OutFox_ supports. 

To use this new driver on your Mac or linux machine, go to your _preferences.ini_ and use one of the following to get your controller to work:

**Please Note: You will need to add one of these so your controller will work!**

**Windows**
```
(para only):
InputDrivers=para,legacy,minisdl

(para and rtmidi):
InputDrivers=para,rtmidi,legacy,minisdl
```

**Mac OS (M1 and Intel)**
```
(para only):
InputDrivers=para,SDL

(para and rtmidi):
InputDrivers=para,rtmidi,SDL
```

**Linux (x86_64/ARM/Raspberry Pi)**
```
(para only):
InputDrivers=para,SDL

(para and rtmidi):
InputDrivers=para,rtmidi,SDL
```

The controller must be plugged in _before_ you start _OutFox_, and it is recommended for M1 based Macs you have a USB C hub that has built in USB2 ports. This will give you the greatest compatibility with older hardware. Do send us your _ParaPara_ setups, we'd love to see them!

# **KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.14.0**

* ❕❌ **ISSUE** Playing ``be-mu``/``po-mu`` songs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading. Please be aware that course mode for these modes are a bit temperamental at the moment!
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``gh`` mode: Some charts may cause a crash when loaded into the game
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``gddm``/``gdgf`` mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it'll play those keysounds silently.
