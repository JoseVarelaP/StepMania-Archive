Right, we finally fixed the annoying RageFile glitch that was affecting the hash system to be different to 5.1/5.0.12. Sorry about all this hassle, we fixed a wedge of bugs in the loading system, but did not expect everyone to have built massive amounts of stuff on top of these bugs being there, so we have adjusted the system so backward compatible themes / API / ScoreShare / Groovestats etc once more work again.

Thanks for being so patient while we ironed this out! it has been a pain!
