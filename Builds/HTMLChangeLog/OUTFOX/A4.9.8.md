![gandalf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/111854863-7b415900-8919-11eb-9890-32d946e868a6.gif)

## **This build requires a cache reset if you are on Linux or MacOSX, due to the internal changes. Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.8 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accomodate the new modes/setup etc.**

---

# **This alpha has tweaked the way the delta clock works, take care to read the information below!**

If you find that your histogram is slightly skewed one side or the other, like the example below, please take a moment to go into _``options``_ -> _``audio offsync``_ and recalibrate your offset. Since ``4.9.7GG`` we have slightly adjusted the renderer pipeline to optimise how we deal with frames within the Kernel Timer of the OS. This is to prepare for new sound/render drivers coming in the near future, but as we've found with a lot in this game, baby steps to fix little blockers before we do major updates. We also have removed more of the Rage Engine in favour of modern mathematics algorithms, and this has needed a slight tweak to the order on how we draw things.

![Broken Offset from 4.9.7GG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115966491-ad039c00-a525-11eb-9282-c63c5476ab2d.png)

This example above shows the mismatched offset from ``4.9.7GG``

![Fixed Offset 4.9.8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115966525-dcb2a400-a525-11eb-9888-538f322ba115.png)

Using the sound offset menu to sync your system, you can get a much tighter response, and this will enable you to chase those fantastics! 
# **Please do the sound calibration in ``dance`` mode! This may not be available in your custom theme, so do it before you swap over!**

## PLEASE NOTE ``F2`` TO RELOAD SCRIPTS HAS MOVED BACK TO THE ``F2`` KEY!!! (for now as it will be a modders debug menu in the future)

## New (and some Old!) Modes Update.
This (slightly delayed) month's update beings some inner reworkings to the gameplay and modes available to play. We are listing them here for your awareness so you can help test them with us, but they will be officially announced in a future release, so please be aware these new modes ARE NOT COMPLETE, and DO NOT REFLECT the final finished versions for their type, due to the fact most of them have no dedicated theme or style setup as they've not been touched in 7-15 years. We are going to stop the trend of 'adding new stuff then doing nothing with it' that was so common in the project we are formed from, so that is not going to continue with OutFox. All modes support all the modding systems that dance does, so for those of you that wish to explore, have at it! Most of these modes are sadly neglected and have been without support or a maintainer for upwards of a decade, so be a touch sympathetic to them if you decide to take the time to explore, they will be given the love they deserve.

Firstly, lets talk about the new modes. These are still a work in progress, but are functional for you to experience.

**If you wish to autogen charts, you can go to _``Options``_ -> _``System Settings``_ -> _``Project OutFox Settings``_ -> _``Autogen Steps``_ to ``ON``. Restart your game, and the autogen will make some charts for you to play the new modes. For a better experience, go to the 'modifiers' menu on player options (when you have selected a song, double tap start) and select ``super shuffle`` as it will rebalance the notes across the new modes, instead of favouring the left hand side. We will be fixing the auto-generator in a future release, but this works well for now for you to at least have a play.**

**The new keybindings for the modes will be updated shortly on our wiki.**

## ``gddm``

![gddm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115624151-1e5b0900-a2f2-11eb-86db-1e0ad0283214.png)

This is a 9 panel (and 10 panel) drum mode based off of the DTX drum kits and inspired by DrumMania, that supports Midi drums and original controllers. Midi support is only on Windows at this time, but we will have a working driver for all platforms by the end of the summer. Gameplay is played on drums, (or keyboard!) and follows the drum use in a chart.

The theming for this mode is incomplete, as is common with a lot of the project at the moment, but again there is enough there to play and experiment with! The editor can be used to create charts, as the new DTX loader for this mode is being built and will be made available in the future. If you have comments or thoughts about this mode, let us know.

---

## ``gdgf``

![gdgf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115628090-f7073a80-a2f7-11eb-8bcd-5db79bea35d9.png)

This mode is based off of the 3 fret/lane guitar mode inspired from Guitarfreaks, however, we have chosen to expand it to include the 5 lane (and a new exclusive 6 lane mode!) for OutFox's inspired mode.

![6 Lane Mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115629639-aa712e80-a2fa-11eb-98dc-26f9ddc5ed0e.png)

``gdgf`` uses much tighter timing than the other guitar mode, so take a moment and test yourself if you're feeling brave! This mode will use the new DTX loader when it's complete, but you can also use Autogen or the editor to have a play with some charts in the meantime. Again, we have yet to build a theme for this mode, so please bear with us while we create new stuff for these modes.

---

## ``gh``

![gh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115625083-76463f80-a2f3-11eb-9bf7-8fe90b0ad69f.png)

This is a 5 lane (and 6 lane coming soon!) mode based off of a collection of popular games that used a guitar styled controller to press frets and strum along to bass and guitar parts of a song. We have added a new ``.CHART`` and ``.MIDI`` loader, and new note types and internal changes so this mode works without being squished around the old 4K ``dance`` engine side.

There will be new theme and broken down menu options for this mode in due course, when we introduce a new experience for those who wish to try it. 

We support ``Jam Mode`` where one player can be one play type, and the other can backup or be rhythm. This has the benefit of adding variety into the play, and allows you both to play different parts of the song at the same time. You can do this on several of the styles.
![Jam Mode Music Select](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115626557-937c0d80-a2f5-11eb-9c88-9d0b3f9f44ec.png)
![Jam Mode Gameplay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115627725-692b4f80-a2f7-11eb-88ef-36272a7447d7.png)


One thing to note! You should go into the player options when selecting a song and ensure that you set the modifications to Constant BPM, and set the speed mod to around C450 to emulate the speed from clone hero or similar.
![Player Options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115626961-24eb7f80-a2f6-11eb-98ec-5ead6be5b4ba.png)

At the bottom of this menu, if you go to ``effects`` and scroll down towards the bottom, you will also see a new selection of modifiers available exclusively in ``gh`` mode:
![gh Modifiers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115627276-9fb49a80-a2f6-11eb-8582-da50e0f9e599.png)

The evaluation and results screens will be reworked in the next version, so ignore the fact it's counting calories and pretending to be dance mode!

## ``popn``

This mode has been around for a very long time, but has not really had any support or been looked at since before 2010. It was side-lined into the BMS loader, which actually broke a lot of the needed changes PMS actually uses, and as a result most PMS files with 7 or 9 lanes, would be added to the game as ``beat`` 10 lane or 14 lane charts. It was known there were issues with this mode, but we were not aware it was broken as bad as it was.

Squirrel would like to thank the anonymous japanese player we'll name "竹 (Take)" girl, for reporting this bug, who wanted to play Nitro's PMS chart of the song on OutFox, but experienced the issue above, and there were also issues with how the keysounds were being loaded for this song in ``popn`` mode and she took the time to give a very detailed report in DM on discord, but deleted her account before we could see her username. I thank you a lot for the report, and if you ever read this, please come and say hi in our discord!

Squirrel took the time to investigate it and it was decided to code a new modernised PMS loader to the game, which now correctly loads PMS songs as they should be. This also removes the oddity and edge crashes when anyone wished to play ``popn`` mode on OutFox. This song, '竹' (Bamboo) charted by Nitro was used as a testbed to debug and ensure it properly works correctly in the game, so we took time to fix it so it would be recognised as a 9 Button PMS file. I'd like to thank Nitro for charting this as we would never have had the report which meant we could fix 13 year old bugs on our PMS and BMS loaders, and to 竹 girl for taking the time to bring it to our attention so we could fix this properly and have a restored mode. You can find them at https://twitter.com/NitroX72 - Thanks again Nitro!

![take bamboo correct parsing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115631765-5b2cfd00-a2fe-11eb-9a5c-e9a2be72014d.png)

We also have added 2 new noteskins from our community member Daniel, which really add to the style of the game. We have cat, cat-retro, bun, and bun retro!

(The theme will be complete for the summer)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115632725-40f41e80-a300-11eb-8d9d-479a82dcb6bf.png)

We have taken some older PMS files from the talented folks at Colorful Channel that also did not parse and work correctly, and these now do show up and play as expected once again.

![colorfulchannel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115634927-7d287e80-a302-11eb-82ba-4e68bf59bc30.png)

As per the BMS/PMS specification, we also have added for the first time, new ``#BGA`` channel ``06 (POOR)``, ``07 (BG2)`` and ``0A (LAYER 2)`` support, and will code these effectively when the theme for this mode is complete. We also support the missing ``LN#`` (Long Notes) that have never been in this game before, as well as the ``#ITEM`` channels.

We will continue to adapt and add the missing functionality from PMS moving forward, now it has it's own loader. This loader now also supports 3 lane (in preparation for battle support), 4 lane for hello pop'n (ハロー！ポップンミュージック) and 5/7 lanes for pop'n portable (ポップンミュージックポータブル). These have been coded and added to the game, with the 3 lane awaiting new PMS code and subtype item code to be added before it will work. There is also a rumoured 18 lane mode, which I'm trying to research. If you know any sources/samples/charts, let Squirrel know!

## ``beat``

Just adding this here to show the 'miss' or ``#BGA06 POOR`` layer in action. As is typical, we have no theme... 

![poor layer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115635229-21aac080-a303-11eb-9ca7-00e095a5e0ca.png)

This needs coding and the proper layout supported, as moving forward we also want to add and support the missing BMS specification as well as add new support via BMSON in the future. It is just part of our pledge to support new and interesting modes moving forwards that we hope folks will enjoy!

---

## ``techno``
![techno9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115636321-9b43ae00-a305-11eb-9d61-aa62d908ee08.png)

We have added the missing 9panel/18panel support from this mode, as requested by a few folks. There was enough demand to add the extra panel. You can create charts for this on the editor, as we do not believe there are any sims for this yet!

18 panel example gameplay is here:
![2021-04-22_023056](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115639039-8538ec00-a30b-11eb-8062-36176b43d1c6.png)

This mode requires good mobility and that you don't use too much polish as slippery pads can lead to falls!

![TM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115639068-984bbc00-a30b-11eb-92bc-90f98ec6e9a0.png)
A Techno 18 panel in the wild, with a cat token collector!

## Changes to Default Theme Pause Menu
This one is important. Due to the need to change the system for the new BGA/Layer system for the BMS/PMS/DTX etc mode support, we have had to adjust the methodology in how the pause menu is drawn by the theme. On the default theme, the ``hold escape to give up`` option has been swapped to give an instant display of the menu. Older/OutFox supported themes that are specifically for ``dance`` will experience no change here, as we have kept backwards compatibility for them. We will look at re-adding this 'hold' option in the future perhaps if it can be sorted within the new modes.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115640138-27f26a00-a30e-11eb-94f1-6cb697b01ace.png)

** New Feature **
## Hold/Roll Tail Type - Lift

This function will add a tail note to all holds and lifts, making it so that you have to lift your foot/finger/etc from the end of a hold. This adds a little bit of a challenge for files, and can help with training for foot positions for players that wish to progress to higher chart difficulties. The benefits of removing the foot at the correct time can enable better preparedness for upcoming streams or any technical that the chart may have, which could be lost because of inaccurate foot removal from holds or rolls.

![tail lift hold](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115637327-cd560f80-a307-11eb-94dc-a365b22074da.png)

On rolls, they have the same behaviour as before, however, the last lift will be done on the 'beat' of that roll. Once more, this trains for better foot stance and movement when a roll ends especially for stamina play. The player will be recorded a normal note 'miss' if the tail lift is not performed at the correct moment.

![roll lift](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115637524-3fc6ef80-a308-11eb-83af-7a4ee3efcc38.png)

These modifiers are available in _all_ game modes, however, not all noteskins will have the support for them, and some themers will need to add these to their player options menus if they wish to add the availability to their theme.
 
![modifier](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/115638879-25424580-a30b-11eb-9c58-592ed8bc3b50.png)

** New Feature **
* ❕✅ Added New ``VideoUpScaleFilter`` Preference

This is for people who took the time to request this availability in the video renderer. The default value is ``0``, which will do no filtering. If you have an older system, take the time to experiment and see how it affects your performance, as this will add a little load onto your system.

The accepted numbered values are:
``0``   - ``none`` <- Recommended for Rpi/Low end machines
``1``   - ``fast bilinear``
``2``   - ``bilinear``
``3``   - ``bicubic``
``4``   - ``X Sharpens + Contrast``
``5``   - ``Point``
``6``   - ``Area``
``7``   - ``Bicublin`` <- Recommended
``8``   - ``Gaussian``
``9``   - ``Sinc``
``10`` - ``Lanczos``
``11`` - ``Spline``

Take your time and experiment with the aesthetic you want for your videos, and your performance of course.

**Windows 7+:**
* ❕✅ Fixed several issues with SDL2's pipeline that was causing weird slowdowns
* ❕✅ Fixed SDL2 issue where sound would crackle and pop on MK9 cabs
* ❕✅ Fixed Issue where XInput controllers wouldn't be seen when in arcade pad mode
* ❕✅ Fixed issue with HIDAPI handles freezing on older Intel OHCI boards
* ❕✅ Changed 2 options to fix a crash with older Intel GPU chips
* ❕✅🐲 Fix buffer overflow on Reflex Pad Driver
* ❕✅🐲 Fix edge crash on 3000+ combo flashes on Reflex Pad Driver
* ❕✅ Add RTIO driver stub

** New Feature **
* ❕✅ Added New ``UsingArcadePads`` Preference

This is for people who have Python Boards, You can set this to enable the driver to work natively without any freezes. As per the work on 'starworlds' you need to set your preference.ini ``InputDrivers=Python23IO,SDL``. This will set up your board driver, and allow you to use keyboard/XInput/Bluetooth controllers to control the game while you're on your pad. You will need to set ``UseOldJoystickMapping=0`` so the game will initialise the XInput controller driver alongside your Python board. 

This preference only currently supports the Python23IO driver, but will be expanded to Reflex and other drivers in the future. 
PLEASE NOTE: You need to add the ``SDL`` on your InputDrivers or you will have no keyboard input!!
