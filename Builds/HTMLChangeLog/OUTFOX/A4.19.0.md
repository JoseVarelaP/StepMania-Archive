title: "OutFox-alpha.4.19.0 Build - The path comes to an end"
---

#### (Incorporates Internal Builds 4.19.0-rc0 to 4.19.0-rc7)

---
Not much to report in this build, many bug fixes, and some patches as reported by users, this is likely the last big patch to the Alpha 4 branch, as the team has moved over to full time development on Alpha V.

We will be pushing the next build of Alpha V (041) to the GitHub, so this space will still be where you can get builds, and do still report bugs if you find any!

Over the next few months you will see some of the Alpha 4 reported bugs either being closed or moved and checked in Alpha V, as a lot of the pump bugs cannot be resolved on 0.4.x so it will be easier to maintain one active branch for the team.

We did this with Alpha 3, 2 and 1, and it's just a natural progression as we build on the work we've done over the past 4 years.

---
Memory cards are sorted out once again! The deadlock bug was fixed.
---
We also have moved the minefix patch to a special function so that it doesn't affect modes that do not require it.
---
This build MAY BREAK YOUR PYTHON2/3 INPUT!! We are looking for folks with the hardware to help us test and fix the drivers. We have had to remove the vulnerable libusb libs/dlls for Windows as they were flagging up as negative.
