## Release Date: 1st May 2023
## Alpha V Playtest Public Build pre041 - 1st Anniversary Celebration

#### (Incorporates Internal Builds 0.5.0-000 to 0.5.0-041)
#### (Incorporates Internal Builds alpha5-silver A0 to A19)

This build continues to stabilise and work on fixes we had begun to work on in 040, which was our last update. Sorry the release took over 2 months! We were working hard all that time!

Thank you for all the reports, and the playing time guys, it is really appreciated, it's allowed us to push on with newer parts of the project that would have been delayed a bit longer if we didn't have you kind folks playing this work-in-progress game.

The ChangeLog is a bit vast for this month, I hope you take a moment to sift through it, but if you have questions, either ping us in discord or leave us a message!

We have fixed the OS issues on Linux and MacOS 12.6.x and 13.x, sorry this update took a while!

We didn't want to patch up all the tiny bits on Steam so we felt it better to just get a big update done - but we won't do that again, it's a bit too hairy for us!

Thank you to all the Mac and Linux users that reported the issues for us to fix, and to you guys for continuing to support our little project, as well as the players signing up to the playtest - we will be opening this up for you all very very soon!

This change list is pretty long, as we have several mini updates in it! I hope you enjoy reading through these, do let us know if there are things we can do to improve this experience for you guys!

=====================================
THIS BUILD HAS A NEW SOUND BACK END!!
=====================================

This build utilises a new back end and completely does away with the old SM5 drivers. It was super heavily requested by the community that we have something configurable that could be used to lower latency in the game for key-sounded and hit sounded modes, so we delayed this build to squeeze it in. There are still a couple of bugs which will be ironed out, but for 99% of users, this build will work fine.

LOW LATENCY AUDIO GET!

With lower latency, comes some compromises. It is super clear and sharp, you have better clarity, it obviously uses new drivers, which include some new preferences, see below.


We have discovered Discord does NOT like low latency based drivers... AT ALL. please bear this in mind if you decide to play with ASIO/set your CoreAudio below 1024, and ensure you have a secondary sound card Discord can use, so you aren't greeted with silence.

WINDOWS:
ASIO supports down to a blocksize of 32 in the internal driver, now while you can set this in the new preferences (see below) if you hear crackling or garbled audio, just raise this a bit. You can use anything from 32 to 4096 as your block size, higher values being higher latency.

WASAPI supports from 64 to 4096, and replaces waveout as the default driver. It has the benefit of not being legacy or using an old back end to output, and can have it's buffer lowered to suit the system.

Lastly we have DirectSound, mainly due to the fact it has been requested for older windows builds, but users should always try to see if WASAPI (which is Vista ->) is available. DirectSound is 512 ->

The new driver has had to be sample rate locked and hardcoded to 44.1kHz right now due to limitations in the back end, but we will be removing all the old legacy code in the coming months, so you will be able to enjoy 48kHz clarity really soon.

LINUX:
ALSA now uses a new back end, as well as no longer using a 15 year out of date code pathway, we no longer have to patch it for OutFox. It fully supports shared mode, so no more silence on calls when you're using it, and it also behaves better on the Raspberry Pi/SoC board for arm, fixing the 10+ year old bugs. If your kernel is pre 4.12, you may get a crash on the first run due to the old kernel code, but the game should find your system devices properly on the second run. We're looking into this atm.

PulseAudio now runs without the ALSA hook, and again isn't exclusive or forces weirdness. It can run with low latency as well, as well as sharing properly. At this release, it will likely use the ALSA device, but we will be adding the option to choose the device the specific APIs can use, so watch this space for that. There is also a quirk with Pulse where it reports the output and input devices back to front, so we have put in a workaround for this too.

JACK - Jack now is built in without the need for extra hooks or compiler options, and simply just... works. If you do not use this driver, do not add it to your preferences, as this can cause a crash right now, it will be fixed in the final version of 041. JACK is also available on MacOS, a bonus feature there.

BSD/CONSOLE:
OSS 4+ is available for BSD builds

MACOS:
CoreAudio now runs newer code as well, which also fixes the odd quirk in Ventura with the audio thread sometimes dropping out. We will also add code for audio device handover, as this new driver supports it, so no more crashing when your bluetooth headphones die and disconnect. Be warned, however, Bluetooth audio can not take a too low block setting, so experiment.

=============================
New Preferences in this build
=============================
SextetStreamInputFilename=
Used for the new Sextet input handler I forgot to code in >.>

SoundrtAudioAPIName=
This selects the audio back end for your system. It will be self populated on first run with a safe default, but you can override it with a comma'ed list of inputs.

You have a choice of the following:

MacOS
core - Use for CoreAudio
jack - Use for JACK

Linux
alsa - Use for ALSA
jack - Use for Jack
pulse - Use for PulseAudio
oss - Use for the Linux OpenSoundSystem

Windows
asio - Use for ASIO
wasapi - Use for WASAPI
ds - Use for DirectSound

They can be used as a list with commas, so "wasapi,ds,asio"

SoundrtAudioLastUsedCard=
This is a pref to highlight the last used card, it's purely for the internal driver, like 'lastseenvideocard'

SoundrtAudioNumberofChannels=
This pref is for number of output channels/speakers your system supports. It will be up to 8 when the code is written, but for now, leave it at 2, due to the legacy code. It will be ignored if you add anything else!

SoundrtAudioPreferredSampleRate=
This pref is for the samplerate of your device, and will be settable in time. It will return the preferred rate your card wants, but will sadly be set to 44.1 due to the restrictions of the legacy code. Will be unlocked when we remove the rest of RageSound

SoundrtAudioSetBufferSize=
This pref is where you set your latency block size. It supports 32 frame to 4096 frames as per the ASIO/latency standards. If your audio crackles or glitches, remember to adjust this, it is not a bug in the game! With lower latency comes a bit more instability, so bear this in mind when you adjust this value.

Linux users will need a lowlatency compiled kernel and preferrably a kernel newer than 4.12 to take advantage of this. MacOS users need Big Sur to use < 256, and Windows 7+ for < 128

This driver is not enabled on windows yet due to some quirks with windows 10/11 which we are looking into.

Sounds can be assigned to either Attract/Effect/Sound, and can be controlled in the menu. The old 'Effect Menu' is gone, and allows you to set the type of audio you wish to edit. Attract volume works on the Jukebox/Attract screen, and can now also be set ABOVE 100%, to a maxium of 200%, for situations where audio lines are quiet and you need a boost for a cabinet.

PLEASE NOTE: This can cause the audio to clip/distort at high volumes, and we are not responsible for your use of this. It has been a very highly requested community feature and we are happy to be able to bring it to you in this build.

Use R to change the Sound Type, and T and Y to set the volume Down and Up respectively.

### OutFox 5.0.0 Pre-Release Candidate 024 - October 17th 2022

THEME: (From Jose)

* ❕✅ Rewritten Judgement loading procedure.
This basically now lets the game record each judgment graphic per
timing window instead of a singular option to rule them all. This
would've become messy if we've kept it like that.
NOTE: This will run locally on the theme for now, to test if the
new functionality is stable to transfer to fallback.

* ❕✅ Music wheel is now dimmable when entering options
* ❕✅ Touch controls are now a toggle

if we let everything be shown at once, so now the Touch controls are
part of a toggle located on the Options menu, which is off by default.

* ❕✅ Fixed PrevScreen on KnownBugs (Reported by Moneko)

Def.AudioVisualizer Info:

It can be added to any existing actorframe, in themes, modfiles and noteskins!

To use it just use the following commands

```
return Def.ActorFrame{
  Def.AudioVisualzer{
    Amount=128, -- The amount of colums, its from min of 16 to a max of 128.
    LinearPeaks=true, -- define if we want lenear peaks, as in a slow animation when it goes back to 0.
    PeakHeight=40, -- the hight of the columns,
    UpdateRate=0.01, -- the update rate of the columns, the lower the faster, between 10 and 0.01.
    OnCommand=function(self)
      self:SetSound(--[[ A RageSound to set--]])
     -- if SetSound is not set, it will fallback to the cur playing music, this does not work for screen gameplay, in screengameplay do
      self:SetSound(SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen():GetSound())
    end    
  }
}

```
