title: "OutFox-alpha.4.9.9HF3 Build - How's that new feature coming along?"
---

![New Game!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/128260941-a55ffd0a-6869-4d31-ada4-fecf8ea89de0.png)
(Incorporates Internal Builds 4.9.9HF-rc0 to 4.9.9HF-rc4)

This build fixes several of the reported bugs, as we had to pull the previous release due to operating system updates between release dates. Sometimes having a monthly release schedule is awesome, but it does tire us out!

Anyways... Lets get back to the update.

This mini hotfix includes a few things we were going to leave to the next release, but as we had to fix bugs in them anyway, it was easier to apply.

---
## Signed Mac builds update!
The big news is we (now finally!) have passed the prerequisites for GateKeeper on Mac, so this hotfix should behave and work fine, without any issues. Do remember to just drag and drop as the dmg lets you know how to do so, and it will run as other applications. Thanks to Jose and Squirrel for their efforts, and Jose for puzzling through, and Jousway for fixing one of the bugs in ``gh`` mode which was causing issuess as well.

---
## Notes Loading
There were several issues with the notes loaders and how antivirus/software protection apps were seeing OutFox when we were loading simfiles. This alpha hotfix now has addressed this by allowing you all to add more than one simfile in a song folder, cutting down on the folder rabbit hole. As we move to a more multi-game engine, this will also allow you to keep things tidy on your drive, and ensure it is a seamless experience for you all. Of course, please check the audio files are the same for the chart you are going to add to the folder, as you may find you have a nasty sync issue, but we also now support multidifficulty setups, as this is required for ``pump`` and ``taiko`` specifically.

---
## Difficulty System Revamp
This hotfix also sees a tweak to the difficulty system used in OutFox. In the past it was tied to the DDR paradigm and then left to rot as one of those 'StepMania Things'. This however really stifled what we could do within the engine, especially with modes with different names/brackets etc. With the release of ``gddm`` and ``taiko`` we needed more difficulties than the game offered, so this has now been resolved. Themes which are based off of 5.1/5.0.x will still work due to the numbers being the same as before. If there are any issues with your theme, do let us know, but we have tested several with no issues.

---
## New ``#VOLUME`` and ``#PAN``
These features have been missing from our keysound support since 2002, and we are proud to say that we have them in this hotfix! They are completely supported in ``gddm`` from the parser, (do reset your cache of course!) and they also work in ``beat``/``popn``. ``taiko`` will need the support as well, so shout out to Jous for putting up with my waaaahh-luigi on getting it added to the game. This build also supports the hidden chips/keysounds for ``gddm`` and we'll work on getting the final compatibility added in due course.

---
## New ``gh`` Modernisation
Due to the need to run with a slightly more secure runtime on _Mac OS Catalina/Big Sur/Monterey_ on the Intel based macs there were some functions in our ``gh`` mode which gatekeeper did not approve of. The way the notes were cast have been fixed, fever/star power has been sorted to be more gh3 like, and taps and open strums are also tweaked to be better. Please give them a try and let us know! A theme for this mode is in the works, so apologies for the barebone approach we have at the moment. It's also why we are an alpha after all...

## In Memorium of SHIKI, a long running well known game music musician, who gave us over two decades of music spanning dance, vocaloid and techno, most of which was charted into BMS, SM and others, sadly passed away this month.

This alpha, our loading screen is in memory of one of his more famous StepMania Based Charts, Air.

**This build requires a cache reset if you are on Linux or MacOS, due to the internal changes. [Please find your save folder](https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/config/folders/) and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.9 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accommodate the new modes/setup etc. Please remember to restart the game after doing a cache build, so you do not have as many issues with memory management.**

## New (and some Old!) Modes Update Version 2
Following on from the last release, we have continued to improve and revamp the note system for the new modes, with Jousway taking the time to make available new types and styles available that were never before. This month fixes some omissions we made from the last release, which slipped through the testing teams.

# ``pump``

![2021-07-24_180342](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/126882998-af475dc4-2c01-4620-af1d-867ba7c255f3.jpg)

We have fixed the scoring bug that was in the previous build, and thank you for those who took the time to report the issues. Keep in mind that Soundwaves still uses 'dance' paradigms for scoring, but other themes that use different scoring systems based on 'pump/piu' should work correctly now.

The tick-count has been tweaked to work correctly as there was a miscalculation in the offset math inherited from upstream. This now behaves as expected.

![2021-07-24_203214](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/126884333-1ffea2e7-6dc4-4d49-9820-09c2429d642d.png)

Getting random misses on hold heads has been resolved as well as the holds with small tails (mini/micro holds).

Support for co-op charts has been added. 5 player is introduced with up to 10 players support, though the noteskins have not been prepared at this time. The numbers on the noteskins are separately labeled so with a few adjustments and extra assets you will be able to update any noteskin to work with co-op. Co-op charts made on StepF2/StepP1 should work on OutFox, however, better note types are currently being developed by Jousway so that there can be more than 3 real players defined. Stay tuned!

Those of you who have reported that we still have a 'superb' bug on holds, this will be fixed when we introduce the new ``piu`` mode - remember the ``pump`` mode is getting Quality of Life updates for now, before we move over to updating things properly in the future.

Micro/Miniholds also do not trigger misses/cause a weird tick to happen anymore, and there also are no 'phantom' mines in long (5+ measure) holds - this was an oddity which has been fixed now.

![pump2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/126884299-09ee5a5c-dfa5-4e4e-bbfa-6d9d157fcd5f.png)

We're still working on improving SF2/SP1 custom charts parsing. Except for a few charts, you can play the majority of content made for it on OutFox with no problems. As always, if you find any oddities make sure you report them to us!

---

# ``popn``
There was also a reported issue where some of the channels (lanes) of the PMS 7 button mode were not parsing correctly, or were actually being missed completely, resulting in a chart 'misplacing' green and blue lanes. This was due to Squirrel misreading the spec on how BMS98/PMS was transcribed and set up the function wrong. It is fixed in this release. 

We also have added 18 lane mode **(No PMS/(BME) File support yet though!)**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/127715610-ba677562-b567-4ef6-b56b-293b199d75ae.png)

Thank you to all of those that took the time to report this and to kick us into getting outfox into a proper BMS/PMS parser. There are still a few features missing from po-mu mode, but these will be added to the game as per the spec (see the table below for more information.)

``popn`` mode also had a few tweaks and adjustments this alpha mainly in how keysounds are loaded within the game. This should now mean the mode should be smoother overall.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/127713730-d7556607-ac7d-4a9e-ba8e-7e1620926fbf.png)

Thanks to the channels being set right, we also are happy to announce another feature to 'popn' mode: 2 player! 
This was not available on the original client, but it did always irk us how there was never 2 player options other than 3 button battle. In a future update, there will be a battle mode for 'popn' but for now, enjoy the 2 player fun. We will finally be having a theme for 'popn' in OutFox really soon, so this is finally a move from the 'dance' centric era of the application's past.

Have some fun with mod files from ``dance`` on ``popn-four``

## **``beat`` will be getting some attention this next quarter!**

---

# ``para``

We have given this mode a polish (and for those with an arcade cab, with 3 sensors doing nothing!) we added the 'fabled' 360, or 8 sensor mode. This mode was designed for in the arcade for when the player twirls or turns, but was never actioned. The sensors for the back are actually there! This mode adds that, and for those who feel adventurous, we will be publishing some information on how to make your own 360 8 sensor panel controller in due course.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/127721393-c4cd720d-b98a-4c60-b592-d36b34be31e7.png)

# ``taitai``

Announcing our 15th mode!

TaiTai is based off of a popular game where you hit a drum in it's face. The game is horizontally based, with the notes travelling from right to left, and you hit the drum when the note gets to the receptor. The orange notes are for the inner part of the drum, and the blue ones are for the outer rim of the drum.

For the moment, some of the quirkier parts of this mode are a work in progress, bear with us as we also write new parsers for this mode. We plan to add support for the special note types and other effects in the game, as well as improve timing and other bits and pieces that are still yet to do. 

Once more, we have no theme for this yet! (We are an alpha after all!) However, we will have a theme available for this soon that will give the mode polish and a playable feel.

We still have the scoring and timing system to finish, along with effects on double notes/taps and the 'roll' notes which you hit as much as you can. Feel free to give it a run and let us know what you think!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/127720586-75c7192b-86dd-4bba-ae00-ed2dca6fbae0.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/127720652-944671e6-b52d-46f1-9924-fe41d0e18349.png)

There is a collection of noteskins including Shizuka, Crystal TaiTai and others.

The autogen for this mode has been rewritten by Jousway to include a more TaiTai aware selection of notes, so that we do not get odd holds/overlaps in things. Give it a try!

---

# ``gddm``

This release sees the long awaited updates to our gddm mode!

The lane drawing has been fixed, so that notes or 'chips' as they are referred to display correctly, and we have properly sorted out the 'merged' lane support.

We have planned to 'straddle' support for the DTXMania NX/Ver. K layouts for the specified channels from the documentation, as these appear to be the most popular branches of this. A detailed channel support list will follow later on.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/127696702-dcbe2713-3976-4396-8ca4-e64784957d84.png)

As of this build we have fixed loading .DTX files and these support *most* of the DRUM based side of the loading, see the table below. This will be improved in time, as we get better knowledge of this system.

We also support the 'combined' lane system which adds lane 2 and lane 3's extra notes, and Real mode (again, REAL filenames are yet to be parsed as such, the engine makes a 'guess' on this!)

``gddm`` still needs a lot of work, and optimisation before we will consider it 'ready', so do expect the odd quirk or weird behaviour, and let us know what you think/would like to see as we define the mode and it's featureset and support. we will be working on the ``gdgf`` parser in the coming months so that the guitar/bass charts will work as well.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/127717604-9b4aad8e-123e-463d-baff-dfbd768202d8.png)

**We do not support XA file decoding at this time, we are looking into options. If you have a dtx file with XA files contained, they will just be played as silence, but won't crash the game.**

# Reordered Game Mode Select Screen

This alpha with the fact we have begun to introduce new modes and features, we have reordered the game modes based on some player/community feedback, with the 'lesser' or 'niche' modes moving down a bit in the order. Makes it easier to find things you need, and please give us feedback if you feel a mode needs more representing/love!

## Mac OS builds are now signed!

We have finally passed all the requirements to be able to sign the binary, so this means no more ``xattr`` stuff anymore! we just act like any other application.

# New Cross Platform MIDI Driver!

Due to the interest we had been getting from the past two alpha releases in the form of gddm and techno, several players that were not on windows did enquire about the possibility of there being a new MIDI driver available for Mac and Linux users to make use of for their midi fighters, e-drums, etc and we decided as a team to move forward and produce one.

The midi driver stands alone, there is no need to have any extra applications 'translating' it to keystrokes, (unless you're doing midi via an iphone or something like that of course), but native midi controllers work a treat. If you have a midi device and want to try this out, you will need to load up your ``preferences.ini`` in your save folder, locate the ``inputdrivers=`` part, and then make sure it looks like this **``inputdrivers=portmidi,SDL``**

This will allow the midi driver to load, and set up your device. We have currently coded it for a single device at a time, but do let us know if you feel there is a need for multiple device support, or if you find a device that doesn't behave!

I also was able to make a prototype mini FSR pad for midi using a teensy LC and some tiny FSR sensors:

![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/845781084356870195/868575186256023602/IMG_20210724_2026112.jpg?width=589&height=520)

This worked a treat, so you can definitely get on to some tinkering if you want to make your own devices to play the game! 

## This driver works on Windows, Linux, RPi, Mac OS (intel) / Mac OS (M1) and Rockchip aarch64 SoCs

We are still working on latency and control, so let us know if you find anything quirky!

## Windows legacy input driver

There has also been work done on a small side part of the game, while we have been waiting for a fix from upstream in regards to the 'polling/framerate' issue that a lot of folks have helping us diagnose for some time. The long and the short of the issue, it meant on some songs, the input would skew towards the update loop rather than honouring it's timestamp, thus producing 'spikes' on the scoring graph at the end of the song, and make a odd looking 'stair' display on the scatter plot of the steps and judgements taken. 

To resolve this while we're waiting a fix, we have reimplemented the old legacy driver that was on 5.2/5.1 and adapted it for OutFox. This driver can be tempremental, but it seemed to behave with the devices we tested it with. If you tend to find that your input is affected with the message loop issue, you can set up the driver with the following instructions. 

 You will need to load up your ``preferences.ini`` in your save folder, locate the ``inputdrivers=`` part, and then make sure it looks like this **``inputdrivers=legacy,minisdl``** 
 
 (if you wish to use the new portmidi driver as well you can use **``InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl,portmidi``**)

 This will allow you to run the game with minimal resources, keeping vsync on, and should remove any previous issues of fps/rate/polling problems. When we have the fix from upstream, we'll revisit and modernise this with the newer drivers and processes.

 On the 'test input' screen, you will see a new Window Handler 'Aux' driver. This is just the driver that manages the window controls, maximises, fullscreens, etc, so no need to worry about it. This will also show you, that you have the correct drivers selected in the inputdrivers setting.

## Rate and Pitch Changes:

Due to an overwhelming set of requests, we have taken time to fix and modernise the rate/haste system which had been broken for a bit since this project began.

Pitch seemed to be a lottery (though we had not seen it work) and all the rate mod used to do was seemingly speed up the song with no other effect or option being honoured.

Similarly, we have moved the ratemod to the first screen of the song options - thanks to the stamina players that popped in to request this, and to ``mattm`` for saying that most wanted a ``speed`` AND ``pitch`` option, which we have called 'both' internally to signify this change.

The new layout looks like so:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/127723002-e4e63c21-5c23-4ab4-af2b-51cb8b0fe18c.png)

We have fixed the way the ``off``/``speed``/``pitch``/``speed and pitch`` options work, so they actually work. This took quite a bit of time to fix the internal pipelines for these, but the end effect is definitely fun. Thanks to Squirrel, Jousway and Jose for bringing this one up the pipeline to get it done for this release!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/127723220-d9a1cdaa-69c0-4a5c-9a85-fb543713fe1d.png)

To ensure compatibility with legacy themes, the system 'defaults' to how it was in 5.0.12, with a 0.01x increase, and being on the main menu as folks requested. This is a long overdue Quality of Life update for this, so we're really pleased it's done.

## **KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9**
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``gh`` mode: Some charts have no real 'standard' and will cause a crash when loaded into the game
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``techno``/``popn``/``gdgf``/``gddm``/``gh``/``para`` mode: Trying to use the sync audio screen will crash the game - Use ``dance`` to sync your game for now
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``gddm`` mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it'll play silent.
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``beat``/``popn``/``gddm`` some early (pre2013) songs may play some sound samples / keysounds at the wrong speed
