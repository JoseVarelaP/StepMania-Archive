## Steam Deck Testing

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/182070164-b155eaf9-b587-4cd5-9be5-5ec6b4cab6a9.png)

We have had a few reports about 'drift' on the Steam Deck, and we have done some testing as part of our development program for Alpha V and can confirm the game runs flawlessly in whichever mode you choose. We've had several users as well as our own deck in testing, and as we are well under way for our Steam launch this would be something that we and our testers would have noticed.

We _will_ however make sure we have a set mapping done for our new Steam Release, but until we get the Early Access Builds out, you can wishlist us [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1751820/Project_OutFox/) and to check out the trailer!

We are excited for the upcoming Steam builds, and remember you can join the discord to help us shape these builds!

## More ``be-mu`` updates

This month we have been polishing the modes ready for their Alpha V debut with proper themes. We have stabilised the way keysounds are loaded, and in this release we have also fixed hidden 'lanes' that the mode supported that were not played. 

The parsing system has also seen another update, moving away from the legacy SM5 method and utilising the new OF style of properly defining and enabling all the lanes. In the past, _StepMania_ could only mainly play a number of sounds related to the number of columns (lanes) and as the BMS reader was created for the historic DDR in BMS style charts, we had a lot of work to do to ensure proper expansion. In this release, the mode has seen some spring cleaning, enabling full keysound range, and properly displays and parses charts as it should.

## Introducing foot support!

We have added a new sub-mode for ``be-mu`` which adds the legacy 'foot' or 'pedal' lane, which was popular in older simulators like _nanasi_. This mode adds one new column to 5 key making it 5 key, scratch, and foot. It heavily utilises channel 17, which some simulators double up as 'free scratch', but for ez2 fans, we wanted to keep it as close to what _nanasi_ and others did back in the day. 

We will not be supporting the much rarer '7k foot' as this was a non-standard extension to the BME specification, and would break ``po-mu`` charts in BME files, which we do support now properly, as it is still used today for charts.

---
## More ``po-mu`` standardisation updates

``po-mu`` mode now also supports Player 1 11-19 channel modes, featured in _nanasi_ and some other simulators from the early 2010s. This is sometimes known as 'extended pomu'. ``po-mu`` now can also play back the correct keysounds, including the player hidden, and any effect channels that can be used.

Charts which did not use all the lanes for their mode, (7k o2j inspired lanes without scratch are an example) would often also not show up correctly, or be shifted by an entire column, or just parsed incorrectly. This has been fixed in this release, so 5K / 7K / 10K / 14K (no scratch) charts now read correctly. Thanks to Daniel and our friends at the BMS international community for reporting this to us.

``po-mu`` in BME files have also been given a proper update, and we have fixed the lane errors that were reported to us, thanks to those of you that took the time to point out our extended channels were wrong!

We are happy now that the ``po-mu`` parser and the extender parser support matches what we aimed for in this mode, so we will finalise the notesloader with #RANK and #TOTAL support in Alpha V, which has the new lifebar and gauge code. Keep an eye out for the update!

## ``pump`` Tweaks and Corrections

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11047768/182074485-cbf0de82-0660-46ed-8e2d-ba7b53558e6f.png)

Thanks to all of our ``pump`` mode players that have been so patient while we work on getting the mode fixed up and right for you, I can appreciate you have been waiting for a long time for some of these issues to be resolved. We have fixed a few of the remaining timing issues and we hope these solve the weird gimmick issues we had before.

Thanks to _shrmp0_ and _SheepyChris_ for helping us with the layout adjustments and column placement changes that are present in the engine this build; we should not expect themers to fix issues the engine really should have in built. A healthy engine makes a lightweight and fast theme.

We will continue working on this mode into the end of the year, so we hope you'll enjoy the fixes as they come!

## Introducing 64bit Windows Builds

We have been testing the 64 bit windows builds for some time, but have yet to publicly release a build alongside our normal release programme, so this month changes that! The community have heavily requested the need for a 64bit build, especially with our multi-modal support system in place, which needs more songs/packs installed. Moving forward to our _Steam_ integration, we needed to have a 64bit build for the users available on that platform.

Moving forward, as a lot of you will have questions; 

> No, we will not be discontinuing Win32. 
 
> Yes, we will continue to provide Win32 builds as many of you with cabs will need them

> _Steam_ will default to the 64bit build unless your system is 32bit.

## Internal library updates

This month we have done several parity pulls from our upstream dependencies, as progress has been made on a lot of the bugs we had in the past. Vorbis and our other sound readers have enjoyed several bugfixes, as well as a big jump in bugs fixed in SDL has meant performance in this build has increased, especially for those on pre-2016 hardware, although everyone should see an improvement.

We have begun to add a few back-ports from the Alpha V Panda collection, designed to build stability as we look to sunset Alpha 4 next Spring. Alpha 4 Officially goes into LTS this month, being limited to only stability and bug fixes only. The main development push from August will be into Alpha V.

We will continue to support Alpha 4.xx until March 2023, but maintaining two separate branches would be too much to deal with for such a small volunteer team, and as a result, it'll be retired properly when Alpha V has matured and stabilised enough to be considered a suitable replacement.

# **KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.16.0**

* ❕❌ **ISSUE** Playing ``be-mu``/``po-mu`` songs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading. Please be aware that course mode for these modes are a bit temperamental at the moment!
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``gh`` mode: Some charts may cause a crash when loaded into the game
* ❕❌ **ISSUE** ``gddm``/``gdgf`` mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it'll play those keysounds silently.
