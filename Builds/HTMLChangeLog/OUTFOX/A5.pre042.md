title: "Project OutFox Alpha V Playtest Public Build pre042"
source: "https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox/releases/tag/OF5.0.0-042"
---

## Release Date: 25th December 2023
New Alpha V build! will update with news when we've had a nap.

This will generate a new cache, and if you're moving from alpha 4 LTS to this build, do not use the same preferences.ini - let the game generate a new one and then match up your settings.

32 bit builds / RPi builds will come in time, but we wanted to get these out for today so you can play an updated build.

Happy holidays from all of us at Project OutFox!!

## OutFox 0.5.0 Pre-Release Candidate 042-a36 SSE3 (Main PRETEST PlayTest Build) December 19th 2023

The OpenGL renderer is now considered deprecated as of this pre-alpha, and OutFox will try to use GLAD first. If that fails, it will fall back to the legacy renderer. This is due to performance and modernisation code we've added the last 2 builds, which gives the game a better usage and speed on systems. You need a GPU from newer than 2005 to support GLAD, or RPi 2+

* ❕✅ Fixed imagecache predefined settings at start
* ❕✅ Set imagecache to resize above 512px by default
* ❕✅ ensure we cache jackets, banners and backgrounds by default
* ❕✅ Fixed invalid bones in characters
* ❕✅ Fixed DancingCharacter loading
* ❕✅ Fixed character bone loading
* ❕✅ Reverted StepsType Change to give notice of the upcoming changes. This will now happen in 044
* ❕✅ Fixed legacy drivers for now on sound
* ❕✅ Fixed sound latency on RPi and SteamDeck/ROG Ally
* ❕✅ Fixed crash with missing stepstypes


Theme Updates:

- Fixed null or 0 profile fitness goals from invoking the resume screen
- Added support for SongSampleModes
(Just like in Soundwaves, you can select the mode in the Experimental settings)
- Added option to toggle Jackets from the music wheel
- Fixed last played text displaying wrong information
- Fix difficulty change not updating high score grade
- Fix style graphics being broken in Evaluation and Edit mode

* ❕✅ Fixed courses not showing up on SelectCourse

### Theme Updates: 

Dance Alpha V:

- Redone the Fitness menu to have a better display for one player
interaction, specifically with touch users.
- You can now select a goal to start a fitness session.
- Graphs in DetailedStats are now properly reset when in Course mode.
- Reworked FadeSlide module for more understandable implementation.
This now allows for precise application of actors and smoother motion
as it is no longer tied to tweens. This new version is stored in
Text.NewFadeSlide.lua, and the original one will be deprecated.

- Join button during attract now goes to Select Profile.
- TotalTimer now updates when changing a song.
- Added options to go to the wiki and the OutFox discord server.
- OptionList now supports URLs.
- Removed approximate difficulties from DiffSelector.
While they're neat looking to see what difficulties are ahead, I can't
deny that they can be disorienting; specially when both areas were
implemented, so I scrapped it and made the parts where you cannot
scroll more obvious.

- SongInfoBox's Title now updates like a scroller.
Given the new updated I did for FadeSlide, this now has better control
when scrolling through songs with long titles, even groups.

- Discord module now just says Attract Screen if its in demonstration.
- Discord module can now track when the player has paused the game,
and show how long have they paused the game, and reapply the remaining
time when resuming.

* ❕✅ Fixed build env for legacy systems as we're using newer libraries
* ❕✅ Fixed dual input on def.optionslist

This driver allows the game to properly work with the deck's controls, which allows for extra joystick/pads/controllers to be plugged in, without Steam overwriting the input causing some of those buttons to be lost when pressed. it requires a different driver setup.

You need to use:
InputDrivers=sdeck,SDL

or if you're using midi as well,
InputDrivers=portmidi,sdeck,SDL

or just the deck:
InputDrivers=sdeck,minisdl

This driver works on windows and linux - it's not complete, I need to disable the mouse/keyboard emulation, but once that is done, we're golden.

* ❕✅ Fixed frame limiter system - if you have an unstable vsync, you can now force a frame rate using the UpdateDrawLoopSeconds pref, which will give you a set FPS update! 

NOTE: If you have an ASUS/Alienware/ACER Gaming/DELL Gaming/MSI Gaming/Medion Gaming/Sapphire Gaming/Sammsung Gaming/HP Gaming system and are running Windows 11 - it will try to throttle your machine to reduce your 'carbon footprint' check your control centre, and your GPU/Controlpanel settings. My own Laptop was throttled to 30FPS on 'office mode' but when switched to gaming mode, this was unlimited FPS! This update has been pushed out over the past 6 weeks, but it is affecting Outfox and many other games as well.

## OutFox 0.5.0 Pre-Release Candidate 042-a14 SSE3 (Main PRETEST PlayTest Build) - August 8th 2023

* ❕✅ NEW!! Introducing support for OutFox's 19th Game Mode - Boxing! This mode is designed to be set up at a gym and played with joy-cons or a similar setup. It's great fun and has a variety of punch styles. We are working on gyro/VRK support so you can play this with those controllers.

* ❕✅ NEW!! Introducing support for OutFox's 20th Game Mode - rb! This mode compliments our gh mode and is based on the familiar chart format .mid The game supports. the mode is made up of rb-easy, which is the normal 4 drum lane without the kick, rb-normal, which is the usual 4 drum lane and supporting the kick, and rb-pro, which is 4 drums, 1 kick and 3 cymbals. You can utilise songs from gh which contain drum charts easily enough! 

.chart is going to be worked on later on, this is just the skeleton remember, so a theme and mode specification and changes will happen to improve the game module, as is done with all our supported games.

This mode also makes OutFox the only sim in the world to support 4 Different game drum modules: gddm, taiko, bongo, rb. We hope you'll be as hype as us for this milestone, and to continue improving our coverage and accuracy in the modules that we support.

rb supports PRO DRUMS out of the box, again the theme is lacking as we need to stop developing crap and focus on it in Q3/4 of this year. This mode also supports our MIDI drivers for eDrum kits! you can now use your eDrums on more than one drum mode!

* ❕✅ NEW!! drum, pro-drum lane support for the mid parser! This required a major rewrite of the parsing system to match one similar to gddm/gdgf so the game knew which part of the chart was drum and such. Please test and let us know if there are any MIDI songs that have issues. Remember .chart hasn't been adjusted yet!

## Note: Mods will be called Gimmicks in Project OutFox moving forward, as we have more modes that use this term, and 'mods' are used for speed, rather than snazzy arrow/object effects. Thanks for understanding! 


To play Gimmick Charts on this build of OutFox, you need to select the GROOVE mode. We have removed the main Gimmick lists and crazy sides from the Dance Mode for performance concerns for folks that play Acc/Stamina. 

Thanks for your support as always, and we hope you like these changes, I know it's a bit mad with all the new gimmicks, but these have been requested for some time.
