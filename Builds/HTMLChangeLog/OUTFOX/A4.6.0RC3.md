ARM notes
=========

*   If you are on newer AARCH64 based Linux distributions such as Arch/Manjaro, you will need to install glu and mesa-git (sudo pacman -Sy glu mesa-git)
*   If the game boots into the GLAD renderer, exit the game and edit VideoRenderers in ~/.stepmania 5.3/Save/Preferences.ini to list **opengl** first.
*   Follow [this tutorial](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/8352-tutorial-opengl-apps-on-opengl-es-gl4es) to get better performance on your ARM device:
*   If you are on a Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+ or 4 and want 64-bit, [this image of Raspberry Pi OS](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2020-05-28/) has native OpenGL 2.1 drivers.
*   As per some of the issues with the in-built systems on the RPi, if you have many entries of broken pipe in your log files and ALSA errors, this is often worked around with a USB sound card or similar. We have not seen anything on Manjaro which matches this, so far it appears to be a Debian issue.
*   Don't expect crazy performance/perfect playback! We are still learning to tweak the engine for better performance on ARM, so please be patient!
