<p>StepMania 5.0.11; release notes compiled and Markdown formatted by <a href="https://github.com/kyzentun">@kyzentun</a>:</p>
<h3 id="this-is-divided-into-two-sections-">This is divided into two sections:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Player visible changes: Bug fixes and a couple new preferences.</li>
<li>Themer visible changes: Bug fixes, new lua functions, new metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Items are roughly grouped into the general part of StepMania they fit into.</p>
<h1 id="player-visible-changes-">Player visible changes:</h1>
<h3 id="edit-mode-">Edit Mode:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beat bars are drawn properly when M-mods are used.</li>
<li>Added &quot;Clear timing in region&quot; to timing menu.</li>
<li>Fixed crash that occurs when &quot;Paste timing data&quot; is used after copying a<br>region of timing data that only contains stops.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gameplay-">Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a pause menu to the default theme. This menu can be brought up by<br>pressing Select or Back twice, or by pressing MenuLeft and MenuRight at the<br>same time. The pause menu allows exiting from the middle of the song or<br>restarting the song or continuing.</li>
<li>In an Endless course, songs will only be repeated after all songs<br>in the group have been played.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="language-">Language:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bahasa Indonesian translation added to default theme.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimaid-">Minimaid:</h3>
<p>Minimaid driver added for Linux. This is practically identical to the<br>Windows minimaid driver that pkgingo wrote.</p>
<h3 id="preferences-">Preferences:</h3>
<p>Added DisableUploadDir preference to skip saving a score entry to Save/Upload<br>every time a song is played. Generating the unique filename can take several<br>seconds when there are years of scores accumulated. This preference defaults<br>to false.</p>
<h3 id="bug-fixes-">Bug Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed No Fakes mod to remove fakes inside warps.</li>
<li>Colon key should be mappable.</li>
<li>BG Brightness is no longer forced to 100% on songs that only have a<br>beginner chart.</li>
<li>Graphics/Sound options screen should not crash or hang on load anymore.<br>The list of resolutions was being fetched in an inefficient and buggy way.</li>
<li>Linux event devices now start at JOY10 instead of JOY1. Without this<br>change, if one dance pad is a joystick device, and the other is an event<br>device, they will both be JOY1, and stepmania will think they are the same<br>dance pad. If you use Linux, assume that you have to remap your dance pad.</li>
<li>Stepmania will force disconnection from the SMO server when entering the<br>jukebox or sync calibration screens to avoid crash.</li>
</ul>
