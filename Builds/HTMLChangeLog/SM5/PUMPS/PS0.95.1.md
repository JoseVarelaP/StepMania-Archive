Hello Everyone!

First of all we want to thank you for such great interest and reporting bugs.

But most of all people who support us on patronite. Every penny means a lot to us. Especially when red Sanita hits us over the head for bugs and takes away the food until we fix all of them. As purple, she's an angel... Her personality disorder... But back to the topic

Unfortunately, it wasn't without problems, including one serious one that made all the results inflated and did not match the original songs.

That's why we decided to reset all scoring and start over.
Our patrons chose the name for this version 0.95.1 also...
