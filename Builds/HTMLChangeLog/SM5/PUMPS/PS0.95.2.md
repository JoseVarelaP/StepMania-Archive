Hello Everyone!

Yes... We know it's weird but we want to release the most stable version for you so that we can disappear again for the next two/three years.

That's why we're releasing version 0.95.2 today, hoping that there won't be any stupid bugs this time around.
Please delete "Cache" folder and if you don't want any problems with "flasches" delete your "Base Songs Packs" (oryginal mixes) and download them again.
