<h1 id="player-visible-changes-">Player visible changes:</h1>
<h2 id="noteskins">NoteSkins</h2>
<p>NoteSkins for 5.1 go in the NoteSkins folder now. NoteSkins made for 5.1.-2<br>will need trivial fixes before they work on 5.1.-3.</p>
<p>NoteSkins for 5.1.-3 and 5.0.x should be able to peacefully coexist.</p>
<p>Remember that NoteSkins for 5.1 go directly in the folder. They are not<br>separated by game type. If you put a NoteSkin for 5.1 inside<br>&quot;NoteSkins/dance/&quot;, it won&#39;t show up.</p>
<h2 id="edit-mode">Edit mode</h2>

<ul>
<li>ThemePrefs</li>
<li>UserPrefs</li>

<li>CustomSpeedMods</li>
<li>ArbitrarySpeedMods</li>
</ul>
<p>Docs/Themerdocs/5.1_incompatibilities/ThemePrefs_removed.md</p>
<p>The lua config system explained in Docs/Themerdocs/lua_config_system.md<br>replaces ThemePrefs, UserPrefs, and GamePrefs. Having a single system for<br>handling custom preferences is easier for developers to maintain.</p>
<p>CustomSpeedMods was replaced by ArbitrarySpeedMods two years ago.<br>ArbitrarySpeedMods is an inferior version of the speed mod menu that is built<br>into the nesty menu system.</p>
<h2>NoteSkins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed various &quot;NewSkin&quot; and &quot;NewField&quot; names to &quot;NoteSkin&quot; and &quot;NoteField&quot;.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="old-notefield-and-noteskin-systems-removed">Old notefield and noteskin systems removed</h2>
<p>Various metrics and functions removed while removing all traces of the old notefield and noteskin system. See Docs/Themerdocs/5.1_incompatibilities/oldfield_removal_notes.md for details.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in beat mod.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>
<ul>
<li>LoadProfileCustom function is now passed the player number the profile is<br>being loaded for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optionrows-deprecated">OptionRows Deprecated</h2>
<h3 id="bad-for-setting-numbers">Bad for setting numbers</h3>
<p>OptionRows is based around picking from a list of choices, not changing a<br>number. So when a number needs to be changed, it&#39;s a mile long list of<br>choices, or a list that is too short to give everyone the needed precision.<br>Look at the mess speed mod choices went through.</p>
<p>The nesty menu system has an actor specifically for showing the current value<br>of the number being changed. Each item on the menu changes the value by<br>some amount.</p>
<h3 id="cannot-handle-dynamic-menus">Cannot handle dynamic menus</h3>
<p>The OptionRows menu system does not have the adaptability to handle dynamic<br>menus. The Noteskin Params menu is one example of a dynamic menu. It allows<br>the player to set options in the noteskin. Those options are created by the<br>noteskin, and can be different for every noteskin. So the menu must be<br>dynamically generated based on the noteskin the player has chosen. When there<br>are two players, they can choose different noteskins. Each player must have<br>their own noteskin params menu.</p>
<p>Dynamically generated menus is part of the core of the nesty menu system.</p>
<h3 id="per-player-menus-handled-poorly">Per-player menus handled poorly</h3>
<p>It is possible to set flags in an OptionRow to only allow one player to use<br>it, but this does not hide the row. The other player&#39;s cursor skips over the row.<br>This feels strange and confusing.</p>
<p>Each player has their own menu, on their own side of the screen in the nesty<br>menu system.</p>
<h2 id="negative-version-numbers">Negative version numbers</h2>
<p>Just a random idea I had one day. &quot;Alpha&quot; or &quot;beta&quot; releases get a negative<br>patch version number to indicate that some things are incompatible with the<br>previous release, and some things might not be compatible with the next<br>release. Eventually there will be 5.1.0, and 5.1.1 after that won&#39;t break<br>anything more.</p>
