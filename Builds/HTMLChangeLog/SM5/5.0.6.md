title: "StepMania 5.0.6"
---

[@kyzentun](https://github.com/kyzentun) made a mistake when fixing a crash bug the night before release that broke bpm editing.  
This fixes that mistake.

Other fixes:
------------

*   Backslash key can be mapped.
*   Deleting steps no longer crashes.

Also, if you didn't see 5.0.5, you should read the release notes for it.
