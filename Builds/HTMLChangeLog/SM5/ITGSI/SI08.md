title: "In The Groove System Image - Version 0.8"
---

- Updated Simply Love to v4.8.6
- Incorporated in auto-gen lights during gameplay
    - This means you no longer need to generate the lighting charts. The game will do so automatically.
    - As such the lighting program and key combos have been removed.
- Added Nvidia card support
    - This was done with the open source drivers, as such performance on older card variants may not be optimal.
