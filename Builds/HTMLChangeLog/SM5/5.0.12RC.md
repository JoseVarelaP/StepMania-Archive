StepMania 5.0.12; release notes compiled and Markdown formatted by [@kyzentun](https://github.com/kyzentun):

Player visible changes:
=======================

### Gameplay

*   Fixed bug that allowed pausing by pressing Select then Back. Pausing  
    requires pressing the same button twice.
*   Default theme ignores holding Back, Select, or Start during gameplay. The  
    pause menu must be used to back out of a song.

### Select Music

*   Added AllowHoldForOptions preference. When this is set to 0 (off), going  
    to the player options screen requires pressing Start a second time, instead  
    of holding it.

### Other

*   Fixed bug that deleted a warp on the same beat as a stop when saving.
*   Ready and Go announcer sounds no longer play simultaneously.
*   Fixed crash in loading profiles from usb drives.
