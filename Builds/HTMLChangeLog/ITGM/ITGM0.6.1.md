(If you downloaded 0.6.1 before `March 25th, 2023 at 11 AM PT`, please redownload as Simply Love wasn't correctly updated).

This is an extremely minor update of v0.6.0 that basically bumps up the included Simply Love version to v5.2.1.

The only other changes are:

* Fixed line ordering for ProfileSortOrder preferences in _fallback (not required if using Simply Love)
* Fixed building on Windows (this fix was included in the released version v0.6.0, just wasn't pushed the `release` branch at the time).
