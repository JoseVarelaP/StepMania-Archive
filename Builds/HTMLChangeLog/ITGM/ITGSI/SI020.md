    - This WILL REGENERATE YOUR CACHE, this can take a moment on first boot
- Update to Simply Love 5.6.0
- P23io support dropped 
    - Itgmania updated to an incompatible libusb variant and would require a complete rewrite.

- Chronyd added for NTP sync of time.
- **Known Issues**:
    - QR codes cannot be scanned using Pixel Camera (fix in 1.0.1)
